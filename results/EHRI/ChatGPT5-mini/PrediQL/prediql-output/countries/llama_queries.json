More importantly, EHRI has identified several repositories relevant for Holocaust research, and described over 60 collections in this country. The Archives of Bosnia-Herzegovina can be considered the most important institution to hold Holocaust-relevant material in the country, as they have a vast collection from the Second World War period and from the Research Commission of Crimes Committed by Occupying Forces. Furthermore, the Jewish Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina [Muzej Jevreja Bosne i Hercegovine], which is a branch of the Museum of Sarajevo [Muzej Sarajevo], and the Historical Archives Sarajevo [Historijski arhiv Sarajevo] have documents concerning the Holocaust. Other archives and institutions in the country which are likely to be relevant for Holocaust research are the Jewish Community of Sarajevo, the Tuzla County Archives [Arhiv Tuzlanskog kantona] and Archives of Republika Srpska, among others.\r\n\r\nOutside of Bosnia and Herzegovina, certain Croatian archives, such as the Croatian State Archive in Zagreb and Osijek, may have further relevant material. In Serbia, the Jewish Historical Museum [Jevrejski istorijski muzej] in Belgrade holds significant amount of material pertaining to the Holocaust period in Bosnia. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) offers a number of relevant oral history interviews, and repositories in Germany and Italy are very likely to have collections pertaining to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\n"

              "summary": "EHRI has identified a number of helpful publications and archival guides on Belgium (see the extensive report). At the same time as EHRI had started its identification and investigation work, the National Archives of Belgium commenced a project which aimed to produce a guide to sources on Jewish life in Belgium. EHRI closely cooperated with this project’s directors and researchers. The identification of repositories holding Holocaust-related collections dramatically improved thanks to this collaborative identification work. \r\n\r\nOne of the most important Belgian archives for Holocaust research is Kazerne Dossin: Memorial, Museum and Research Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights. This museum and research centre actively collects material, often private collections, about the Holocaust in Belgium. It holds the largest collection of materials on the topic in Belgium, including original, photocopied and scanned materials. EHRI supported Kazerne Dossin by helping them transfer the existing texts into archival descriptions according to international archival standards and integrating new descriptions into this system. This resulted in a major step forward for Kazerne Dossin: from 17 collection descriptions, Kazerne Dossin now provides EHRI with hundreds of descriptions. It is continuing this effort in order to make all its materials publicly available on a collection level.\r\n\r\nMade up of the National Archives, 17 State Archives in the Provinces, the Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (CEGESOMA); and the Directorate-General for War Victims, the State Archives are another significant institution that hold Holocaust-related material. In particular, the National Archives branch in Brussels conserve the archive of the former Military Justice system, which includes all the post-war trial records. Some important city (and communal) archives also have Holocaust-related material, such as those of Brussels, Antwerp, Liège, Charleroi and Ghent. Moreover, EHRI has worked closely CEGESOMA. Collection descriptions from the Centre were selected via key-word selection and literature search (verification of bibliographies of key works on the Holocaust in Belgium) and integrated onto the Portal by EHRI. This export includes archival documents, manuscripts, interview descriptions, and photo descriptions. As for the Directorate-General for War Victims, it possesses one of the largest and most important collections on the Holocaust in Belgium from the victims’ perspective.\r\n\r\nThere are also several important private archival institutions in Belgium. Notably, the Jewish Museum of Belgium in Brussels, which holds important sources related to the victims, as do some remembrance organisations, such as the Auschwitz Foundation and the Foundation of Contemporary Memory, which collect testimonies.\r\n\r\nMany other sources are stored in repositories outside of Belgium. First of all, there are the archives of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (with branches in New York and Jerusalem) and the World Jewish Congress records on Belgium (stored at the Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati). The Yad Vashem archives hold both original and copied materials on Jews in Belgium, including the original documents of the Belgian Jewish Committee in London during the Second World War. Likewise, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum holds vast materials on Jews in Belgium, both originals and copies. Their copy collection on Belgium includes copies from Kazerne Dossin, the Directorate-General for War Victims, CEGESOMA, and the National Archives (Foreigners’ Police archives, Brüsseler Treuhandgesellschaft collection, Archive of the Diamond collection and other files). The USHMM’s original collections include the “Fela and Chaïm Perelman papers”. The extensive report on Belgium also includes references to publications on sources on Belgium stored in German and French archives (most notably, the German sources on Belgium kept at the French National Archives at Pierrefitte-sur-Seine, the sub-series AJ40, and those kept at the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv Freiburg)."

Other Central and Regional Archives also hold Holocaust-related documents. These are Military Archive in Veliko Tarnovo and also the regional branches of the Central State Archive. Outside of Bulgaria, relevant material from the Holocaust-period can be found in a number of institutions. EHRI was able to identify, among other institutions, the German Bundesarchiv in Berlin Lichterfelde and in Freiburg, the Politisches Archiv des Auswärtigen Amtes, and Yad Vashem in Israel. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has copied a considerable quantity of Holocaust-relevant archival material from Bulgaria based on the collection of the Archives State Agency.

EHRI has identified over 25 archival institutions in Belarus which hold Holocaust-relevant material. Seven of them are located in the country’s capital Minsk. For a complete list, see the EHRI extensive report on Belarus.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there are regional, “zonal” or otherwise specialized archives with Holocaust-relevant collections which can be found in 14 urban centers of Belarus, namely in Baranavičy, Babrujsk, Barysaŭ, Brest, Hlybokaje, Homiel, Kobryn, Lida, Mazyr, Orša, Pinsk, Polack, Rečyca and Viciebsk. They are also listed in the EHRI extensive report on Belarus.

When the Israeli Parliament entrusted Yad Vashem with the mission to commemorate the Shoah and its victims in 1953, Yad Vashem began to systematically collect Holocaust-related documentation from all kinds of sources.\r\n\r\nThe first documents arrived at Yad Vashem from the “Historical Commissions” and various documentation centres established after the war, mostly by Holocaust survivors, but also from public institutions, researchers and private individuals. Material collected in Israel was added to the documentation collected by Jews during the war in the ghettos, camps and hideaways, as well as materials collected in the first years after the war, for example in DP camps. Since its establishment, the Yad Vashem Archives have initiated activities with a view to collecting and copying Holocaust-related documents that have been housed in various archives in Europe and throughout the world.

For more detailed information on the activities and holdings of the Yad Vashem Archives, see the extensive report.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Yad Vashem, the Ghetto Fighters House, the Massuah Institute for the Study of the Holocaust, the Moreshet Mordechai Anielevich Memorial and the Kiddush Hashem Archive are important institutions that hold and collect Holocaust-related sources.

Furthermore, the Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People, the National Library of Israel, the Wiener Library for the Study of the Nazi Era and the Holocaust at Tel Aviv University, the Central Zionist Archives, the Jabotinsky Institute in Israel, Beit Theresienstadt, and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee should be mentioned here.

              "history": "Austria was occupied and annexed by the German Reich in March 1938. Many Austrians welcomed this “Anschluss”, after which they were treated as Germans. On April 10, 1938, the “Act on the Reunification of Austria with the German Reich” was recognized by a referendum. Austria was integrated into the general administration of the German Reich and subdivided into seven Reichsgaue in 1939. In 1945, the Red Army took Vienna and eastern parts of the country, while the Western Allies occupied the western and southern sections.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Austria had a total population of about 6,753,000 people. After the “Anschluss” [annexation], 206,000 of them, including refugees from Germany, were persecuted as Jews under the Nuremberg Laws. The Austrian Nazi Party, which had been outlawed before the “Anschluss”, however, did not target only the Jews, but also other ethnic, social and political groups, such as the Roma, their political opponents, the disabled, “anti-social elements”, and others. In the process, Austrians became involved in all types of Nazi crimes. In the first days and weeks of Nazi rule, Jews were subjected to brutal outbreaks of violence, including theft and murder. Subsequently, most Jews in the provinces were forced to move to Vienna or abroad. The “Zentralstelle für jüdische Auswanderung in Wien” (“Central Office for Jewish Emigration in Vienna”), founded by the SS in August 1938, not only served as a model for the organisation of the expulsions, but also for the mass deportations from October 1939 onwards. Similar institutions were founded in Berlin, Prague, and Amsterdam. After the November pogroms in 1938, about 6,500 mostly male Jews from Austria were imprisoned, and 4,000 among them were sent to the Dachau concentration camp. By the beginning of the war in September 1939 about 130,000 Jews fled from Austria. During the war, the remaining Jews in Austria were subjected to ever increasing isolation by new regulations, including forced transferal to smaller quarters and the introduction of the obligatory Jewish Star in 1941. Austrian Jews were deported to ghettos, concentration and extermination camps, among others to Nisko, Kielce, Opole, Theresienstadt/Terezín, Litzmannstadt/Łódź, Riga, Maly Trostinez/Maly Trascianiec and Auschwitz-Birkenau. In May / June 1944, Jewish prisoners, mostly from Hungary, were moved to camps in Austria, particularly to the Mauthausen concentration camp complex and forced labour camps along the Eastern border. Especially in March and April 1945 thousands of them died on death marches. Overall, around 66,000 Austrian Jews perished in the Holocaust. \r\n\r\nThere were about 11,000 Roma living in Austria before the war. They were subject to harsh racist campaigns throughout the first decades of the 1900s. Shortly after the “Anschluss” in March 1938, Roma and Sinti were deprived of their rights as citizens and several hundred were deported to concentration camps. Since 1939, many detention camps (so-called “Zigeunerlager” [“Gypsy Camps”]) were erected in several places all over Austria. The largest camp was Lackenbach, which held around 4,000 Roma from the Burgenland. In November 1941, 5007 Austrian Roma were deported to the ghetto in Litzmannstadt. No one survived: They died in the ghetto or were murdered in Kulmhof. Since March 1943, Sinti and Roma were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Of the estimated 11,000 pre-war Roma, Sinti and Lovara population who were Austrian citizens in 1938, only 1,500 to 2,000 survived. "

The Australian government was initially hesitant in permitting entry to many Jews, but in 1938, it allotted 15,000 visas to “victims of oppression”. Some 7,000 Jews were able to obtain these visas before the outbreak of the Second World War put an end to the program. Jews from Germany were interned as enemy aliens from the start of the war until 1942. In the aftermath of the Second World War, Australia gradually abandoned its previous Anglo-centric immigration policy and permitted immigration of some European Jews who were survivors of the Holocaust.

In April 1941, when Germany’s twelve-day campaign against Yugoslavia led to its partition between the Axis powers and their allies, Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of the Independent State of Croatia [Nezavisna Država Hrvatska, NDH], founded on 10 April 1941. While the Ustaše movement and its leader (Poglavnik), Ante Pavelić, assumed authority, the new state depended on German and Italian support. The Independent State of Croatia effectively ceased to exist in May 1945. Bosnia and Herzegovina became one of the six republics within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It declared independence in 1992.\r\n\r\nBefore the Second World War, Bosnia and Herzegovina had a total population of 2.5 million inhabitants. Of this population, about 14,500 were Jews spread throughout some 20 Jewish communities. Between 1933 and 1940, this number greatly increased as some 55,000 Jews from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia fled through the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Only 4,000 of these Jews remained in April 1941. The Ustaše movement implemented a policy of discrimination, expropriation and mass murder against Serbs, Roma, communists, and Jews. The Independent State of Croatia established a number of camps. In 1941, deportation of Jews began to concentration camps in Gospić, Jadovno, Jasenovac, Stara Gradiška, Đakovo, Loborgrad and others, and in 1942, to Auschwitz. Concentration camps claimed the lives of almost 80 % of Jews from Bosnia and Herzegovina. About 10,000 members of the pre-war Bosnian Jewish population had been murdered by 1945.\r\n\r\nAt least around 4,000 Roma lived on the eve of the Second World War in the territories of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina. The pro-fascist Ustasha movement led a genocidal policy towards the Roma in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Part of the Muslim intellectual and religious community claimed that 'White Gypsies' (Muslim sedentary Roma) must be considered as an integral part of the Muslim community ('Aryans') and therefore be spared from persecution. Such views and demands were published in May 1942 in the 'Zenica Resolution' which was accepted by the Ustasha authorities. A significant part of the rest of the Roma community was persecuted mostly through deportation to camps (especially the Jasenovac camp), where they were tortured and killed. Some Roma joined the anti-fascist partisan resistance movement. Despite some Muslim Roma being rescued during the war, the Roma community was still devastated. In the census of 1948, there were only 442 Roma identified."

              "history": "Belgium was invaded by German forces on 10 May 1940 and surrendered on 28 May under the orders of King Leopold III. The King stayed in Belgium, but the Prime Minister and many cabinet members fled to London, where they set up a government-in-exile. The German occupiers formed a military administration (for Belgium and Northern France), led by Alexander von Falkenhausen, which was replaced by a civilian administration in July 1944. Belgium was liberated in September of that year, although the fighting and bombing continued in parts of the country until May 1945.\r\n\r\nDuring the occupation, German orders resulted in the registration of about 57,000 Jews in Belgium, out of a total Belgian population of over 8 million. Of those Jews, 10 percent at the most were Belgian citizens; the others were mostly recent immigrants from Eastern and Central Europe. Over 90 percent of the Jewish population resided in Brussels and Antwerp. Shortly after the German invasion, the Belgian government arrested a few thousand German (and Austrian) nationals, including Jews, and sent them to camps in France. The Jews among them were later included in the deportations from France. Anti-Jewish legislation was first enacted in October 1940, while the economic plundering of the Jews began in May 1941. In April 1941, a pogrom took place in Antwerp, organized by local anti-Jewish organizations. In May 1942, the Yellow Star became obligatory. Then, in July 1942, Jews were summoned to the Dossin barracks [\"Sammellager Mechelen/Malines\"], a new transit camp in Mechelen (a city between Antwerp and Brussels) through an “Arbeitseinsatzbefehl” [“work order”]. In the summer of 1942, the German police forces and their collaborators actively started looking for Jews, with large raids taking place in Brussels and Antwerp. The deportations began on 4 August 1942 and lasted until 31 July 1944. A total of 28 convoys left the Dossin camp, mainly for Auschwitz, four convoys left for other camps: one to Ravensbrück-Buchenwald and Bergen-Belsen, and two to Vittel. Overall, 25,490 Jews arrested in Belgium and northern France were deported from Mechelen. The vast majority perished in the camps, approximately 1,700 survived.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War, a few hundred Sinti and Roma lived in Belgium. The Belgian’s Aliens Police particularly targeted Roma and Sinti in its activities to take action against those who were considered a threat to national security or public morals. On 21 December 1941 the Belgian Aliens Police introduced the so-called “Carte de Nomade / Zigeunerkaart” [“Gypsy Card”], a new identification card exclusively for Sinti and Roma. These temporary residence permits had to be renewed every three months and later served to track people down in raids and for deportations, which started in 1943. 352 Sinti and Roma, arrested in Belgium and Northern France were deported from the Dossin barracks [\"Sammellager Mechelen/Malines\"] on 15 January 1944 to Auschwitz-Birkenau. 10 individuals were deported there separately. 34 of them survived."

Territories in both occupied countries came under Bulgarian military and civilian administration. Bulgaria’s involvement in the wars of the Axis, however, did not go any further. Bulgaria did not join Hitler’s war against the Soviet Union; it did not sever diplomatic ties with the Soviets. In August 1944, Bulgaria began to distance itself from the Axis. The government declared war on Germany on 8 September 1944, only to be overthrown by a communist coup one day later as the Red Army entered Bulgarian territory.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Second World War, Bulgaria had 6,341,000 inhabitants. Among them were some 48,000 Jews, most of whom lived in the capital Sofia. In January 1941, the pro-Nazi government, despite public opposition, introduced the antisemitic “Law for the Protection of the Nation” which put numerous restrictions on the country’s Jews. It was implemented by the specially created Commissariat for Jewish Affairs [Komisarstvo po Evreyskite Vuprosi, KEV]. After 1941, all Jewish men between 20 and 45 years of age were drafted for forced labour and mainly put to work building roads and railways. In February 1943, the head of the KEV, Alexander Belev, and the German SS-Plenipotentiary Theodor Dannecker signed an agreement for the deportation of 20,000 Jews from Bulgaria’s “new territories”, in Macedonia and Thrace. Since there were not enough Jews in these areas (slightly above 11,000) to reach this figure, the rest were to be taken from a number of towns in Bulgaria. 11,343 Macedonian and Thracian Jews were deported by Bulgarian and German authorities to Treblinka and murdered there in March 1943, but no Jews from Bulgaria proper. The Bulgarian government resumed planning to meet the German demands for the deportation of Jews from Bulgaria in May 1943 (which met with public protest). The Bulgarian Jews, except those who lived abroad under German occupation and were denied Bulgarian help, survived despite the hardship of the war years. Anti-Jewish laws were formally repealed in late August 1944. At the end of the war, 49,172 Jews lived within the old boundaries of Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nAccording to a 1934 census, there were 149,385 Roma living mostly in villages in Bulgaria. Roma communities were subject to discrimination, forced labour, and restricted movement. Roma living in Bulgarian occupied territories were subject to various kinds of persecution\r\n"

              "history": "The territory of what is present-day Belarus was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793. In January 1919, the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed. After the Polish-Soviet War of 1920, the western regions of Belarus, including the cities of Brest, Hrodna, Nowogródek (Navahrudak) and Pinsk, were incorporated into Poland, while the east remained part of the Soviet Union. Following the Ribbentrop-Molotov Agreement, the Red Army occupied eastern Poland in September 1939 and reclaimed previously lost territory. When German armies crossed the Soviet border on 22 June 1941, they seized the capital of the Belarusian Soviet Republic, Minsk, within a week. By September 1941, Germany controlled all of Belarus. The western part of the occupied Soviet Republic came under a civilian administration, while the east was administered by the military. The territory under civilian administration was divided between the White Ruthenia General District (the main portion of the territory) and the Lithuania General District (the north-western part), both subordinate to Reichskommissariat Ostland. Other areas were attached to Reichskommissariat Ukraine (in the South) and the Białystok District, which was attached to the German Gau East Prussia (in the North-West). The Red Army ended the German occupation of Belarus in August 1944. Belarus declared independence from the USSR in August 1991.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the German invasion, the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic had an estimated total population of 9,200,000 people. About 700,000 of them were Jews. According to various estimates, between 153,000 and 165,000 Jews from Belarus managed to flee or were evacuated when Germany invaded. The main perpetrators of the murder campaign were members of Einsatzgruppen A and B and the Security and Order Police stationed in Belarus. Most of the Jews in Belarus were exterminated in two major waves: between the late summer and winter of 1941 and during 1942. As the scope of mass murder widened, the Germans increasingly relied on local collaborators and collaborating organizations. The last Jewish ghettos in Western Belarus were liquidated in the summer of 1942, while the Minsk Ghetto, one of the largest in Europe, was fully liquidated by October 1943. The percentage of Jews who perished in Belarus during the Holocaust is among the highest in Europe. The number of victims has been estimated to be at least 450,000 and may be in the range of 600,000, including Jewish refugees from Poland. In Belarus, the Germans not only murdered Jews living in the country, but also Jews from the Reich or Bohemia who were deported or escaped to Belarus from all over Europe.\r\n\r\nRoma have had a presence in what is today Belarus since the 15th century. According to a Soviet census conducted in 1939, there were 3,362 Roma living in the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (BSSR). The actual number was higher because the western parts of Belarus belonged to Poland at the time (and no census data exists for this area) and some Roma were registered as Belarusians or Russians. Little is known about the history of Roma living in the western parts of Belarus under Soviet rule between September 1939 and June 1941. Under German occupation, Roma communities were subject to displacement, forced labour, and concentration. Most were killed on the spot in summary executions and mass shootings by both German soldiers and local collaborators. It is estimated that at least 3,000 Belorussian Roma were killed."

Under the leadership of Liberal Prime Minister William Mackenzie King, the federal government set up highly restrictive and ethnically selective immigration policy. For the period 1933-1945, between 5,000 and 10,000 Jewish migrants were accepted into the country, many of whom arrived before the war started. During the war, the arrivals were very limited; some 2,000 German and Austrian Jewish “enemy aliens” were transported from Great Britain and interned in Canada, and 400 refugees came from Spain and Portugal in 1944. Conversely, after the war, Holocaust survivors became one of the immediate post-war era’s largest migrant categories: From 1947 to 1955, 35,000 of them resettled in Canada. \r\n\r\nFor this country there are no sufficient findings on the history of Roma during the Second World War.

              "history": "When Germany invaded Poland, the Swiss Federal Council called for general mobilisation and formally declared neutrality. The Parliament elected a war-time commander-in-chief of the army who, along with the Federal Council, issued joint orders to resist any invader in April 1940. German plans to outflank the French through Swiss territory were dismissed. While Switzerland enjoyed the double advantage of being a secondary objective for the Axis powers and of being able to deter attackers thanks to difficult terrain and quite a formidable military force, the country found itself effectively surrounded by Axis territory after the fall of France. The last remaining exit was closed off after the German occupation of Vichy France in November 1942. Switzerland maintained armed neutrality throughout the Second World War.\r\n\r\nBefore the war, Switzerland had a total population of about 4,066,400 people. Some 19,000 of them were Jews (half Swiss, half foreign-born). While Switzerland provided asylum to political refugees from Germany after 1933, Swiss authorities did not consider “racial” persecution a valid reason for asylum. While some 30,000 Jewish refugees who reached Switzerland during the war were admitted, approximately the same number was turned back at the border. At the end of the war, as part of efforts to aid concentration camp prisoners, Switzerland accepted transports of Jewish prisoners from various camps, including Bergen-Belsen, Theresienstadt and Buchenwald.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland imposed several anti-Roma policies prior to the First World War such as prohibiting Sinti and Roma from traveling by rail or boat, a ban on entering the country, and identification through an official registry. During the Second World War, refugees of the minority were returned to Nazi Germany or imprisoned while awaiting expulsion. Those who were already Swiss residents faced forced sterilization and abortions. The 1906 ban on Romani people entering Switzerland was lifted in 1972."

              "history": "The Bohemian lands (Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia) were part of the Habsburg monarchy until the First World War, and of the First Czechoslovak Republic between 1918 and 1938. Following the signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938, the border territories along the nowadays German and Austrian frontier were annexed by Germany (and a small part of Silesia by Poland). Most of these areas were reorganized as the Reichsgau Sudetenland, while areas in the West and South were attached to neighboring German Gaue. Further territorial losses between September and November 1938, led to the federalisation of Czechoslovakia (Czecho-Slovakia). In March 1939 Nazi Germany occupied the rest of the Bohemian lands, creating the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, with its own government and administration under close German supervision. The German-occupied Protectorate functioned up to the end of the war in May 1945.\r\n\r\nIn 1939, the Bohemian lands had a total population of about 11 million inhabitants (10,674,386 according to the 1930 census). After the Munich Agreement, most of the approximately 25,000 Jews from Sudetenland escaped or were expelled into the interior of the country. In the Protectorate, the occupiers regarded some 118,000 inhabitants as Jews. This Jewish community had modernized and had largely assimilated with German and Czech society in the Bohemian lands. In the context of rising nationalism and antisemitism, the first exclusionary measures were already taken during the Second Republic (1938-39). After the occupation, the Germans, as well as the semi-autonomous authorities of the Protectorate, imposed laws and various ordinances to discriminate against Jews and confiscate their property. In autumn 1939, some 5,000 Jews were deported from Vienna and Ostrava to Nisko. Before further emigration was banned in 1941, 26,000 Jews emigrated legally and several more illegally from the Protectorate. In 1941-42 several thousand Jews were deported to the ghettos of Litzmannstadt, Riga and Minsk, where they shared the history of the local Jewish population. In November 1941 the Theresienstadt [Terezín] ghetto was created; over 80,000 Jews from the Bohemian lands, but also more than 60,000 from Germany, Austria, and other Nazi-controlled territories were deported there between 1942 and 1945. Theresienstadt became a transit ghetto, because most of the prisoners were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau and other extermination camps. About 33,000 Theresienstadt (mostly elderly) inmates perished in the ghetto due to the harsh conditions. In 1943-44, approximately 17,500 prisoners were deported to the Theresienstadt Family Camp in Auschwitz-Birkenau which was probably created for propaganda purposes. Most of the prisoners were killed in two large actions. At the end of the war there were 2,800 Jews in the Bohemian lands (most of them from “mixed” families), but the number of survivors was larger (about 14,000, together with the surviving deportees). Altogether, about 80,000 Czech Jews perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nDuring the interwar period, approximately 70–100,000 Roma lived in the territories of the whole Czechoslovak Republic. The vast majority lived in Slovakia. After the Anschluss in 1938, anti-Roma sentiment radicalized, and the population faced increasing discrimination. After the establishment of the Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia in 1939, legislation and praxis towards Roma and Sinti was adjusted to the regulations already valid in Germany. Around 6,500 Roma were racially categorised by official authorities, many were deported into the detention camps Lety near Pisek and Hodonin near Kunstadt and later deported to Auschwitz. The Roma population in Bohemia and Moravia was almost completely destroyed. "

              "history": "Adolf Hitler was appointed Reich Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Within half a year, his National Socialist German Workers’ Party succeeded in establishing a one-party dictatorship. Political enemies of the Nazis were taken into “protective custody” and held in concentration camps under emergency regulations. After the death of Reich President Paul von Hindenburg in 1934, Hitler declared himself head of state. As of 1938, the German Reich expanded by force, annexing Austria and the Czech Sudetenland. It seized the remaining Czech lands in March 1939. In September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, thus provoking declarations of war by Poland’s allies Great Britain and France. During the ensuing Second World War, German troops occupied much of continental Europe. Throughout the areas under German control and in territories controlled by its allies, apparent and actual resisters, as well as “racial” undesirables, were persecuted and murdered. Most German territory was occupied by the Allies by the spring of 1945. The German army unconditionally surrendered to the Allies in May 1945.\r\n\r\nIn early 1933, the German Reich had a total population of over 65 million inhabitants. About 552,000 of them were adherents of the Jewish faith. Many of them opted for emigration when they were threatened by Hitler’s rise to power. As antisemitism was a cornerstone of his Nazi Party’s ideology, it was quickly put into practice. Supported by a prevalent antisemitic sentiment in Germany, the Nazis propagated their pseudo-scientific “racial” anti-Jewish beliefs, managing to exclude German Jews both socially and economically: According to the May 1939 census, which applied “racial” criteria, there remained approximately 242,000 so-called “full Jews”, some 20,000 of whom were not adherents of the Jewish faith. The Nazis considered 85,000 other people as “half-Jews” and “quarter-Jews”, in other words, people with a certain degree of Jewish descent.\r\n\r\nIn April 1933, a Reich-wide boycott of Jewish businesses was implemented and all Jews were dismissed from state employment. In 1935, the racist Nuremberg Laws forbade marital and sexual relations between Germans of non-Jewish descent and those of Jewish descent, unless they were already married. Jewish businesses and properties were subject to “Aryanisation”, which amounted to full-scale expropriation of the Jews in Germany. After leaving behind most of their possessions, many of those who successfully emigrated from Germany during the 1930s settled in European countries which were later affected by the Holocaust. During a Reich-wide pogrom in November 1938, practically all synagogues in Germany were systematically attacked and destroyed, Jewish shops and homes looted, hundreds killed and some 30,000 Jewish men taken to concentration camps. German antisemitic ideology and propaganda increasingly affected Germany’s allies and spread to all occupied areas.\r\n\r\nAfter the start of the war, the remaining 214,000 Jews in Germany were almost completely isolated, suffered from radically reduced rations and soon had to move to special “Jewish houses”. They were now obliged to join the Reich Association of Jews in Germany [“Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland”], which was overseen by the Gestapo; many Jews were subjected to forced labor and the first attempts at mass deportations were made in 1939/40. In autumn 1941 the obligatory “Jewish Star” was introduced and the few remaining possibilities of emigration were shut off. For all but a small minority of Jews, mostly those protected by so-called “mixed” marriages, the deportations “to the East” began. There, they were either murdered upon arrival or temporarily left in impossible living conditions. Ultimately, those who survived were sent on to extermination camps. Very few of the deportees survived the war. Most early deportations went to the Reichskommissariat Ostland, the Litzmannstadt Ghetto or camps and ghettos in the General Government in occupied Poland; later deportations were mostly directed to the Theresienstadt Ghetto or went straight to Auschwitz. As of mid-1943, the Reich was declared “free of Jews”; the remaining 20,000 Jews, most of them in “mixed marriages” or of “mixed race”, were completely excised from German law and entirely subject to the Gestapo. Only very few were able to go into hiding. Beginning in mid-1944, up to 200,000 Jewish forced laborers, mostly of east-central European descent, were brought from camps and ghettos outside the Reich to concentration camps inside Germany. As the Allies approached the Reich, members of the large Jewish prisoners’ group in particular were forced on so-called death marches and many died. Overall, about 130,000 Jews deported from Germany (and 35,000 German Jews deported from other countries) perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nThe approximately 20,000 Sinti and Roma (1933) were also excluded from the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" as a \"foreign race\" in accordance with the Nuremberg Laws. The first mass deportations to concentration camps began in the summer of 1938, and a systematic total registration of the entire minority started in the fall of 1938, which was implemented by the criminal police in close cooperation with the Racial Hygiene Research Unit in Berlin. In May 1940, the first family by family deportation of around 2,500 Sinti and Roma to German-occupied Poland took place, and in December 1942, Heinrich Himmler ordered the transfer of all Sinti and Roma to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration and extermination camp. Around 15,000 German Sinti and Roma were murdered, and around 2,000 Sinti and Roma were forcibly sterilized."

              "history": "The German army occupied Denmark on 9 April 1940. Until 1943, the occupation regime appeared relatively benign: It dominated foreign policy, but allowed the Danish government complete autonomy in domestic affairs, including control of the legal system and police forces. The tone of the German occupation changed in early 1943. Rather than yield to German demands, the Danish government resigned on 29 August 1943. German authorities took direct control of the Danish military and police forces. Other parts of the administration still remained in Danish hands. The German occupation of Denmark ended in May 1945.\r\n\r\nBefore the Second World War, Denmark had a total population of 3.85 million people. Approximately 6,500 of them were Jews. Their community consisted mostly of some 6,000 native Danes, while the rest were refugees from Central and Eastern Europe. Most Jews lived in Copenhagen, the country's capital and largest city. Considering the relatively small Jewish population and the support most Danes gave to their fellow Jewish citizens, Germany initially followed a general policy of non-interference regarding the “Jewish question”. After the implementation of martial law in August 1943, the order for the deportation of Danish Jews reached SS General Werner Best, the German civilian administrator in Denmark, on 28 September 1943. Approximately three weeks earlier, Best himself had taken the initiative to ask Berlin if the Jews in Denmark could be arrested. However, before the arrests could be carried out, the Danish authorities, Jewish community leaders, and countless private citizens mounted a massive operation to help Jews go into hiding or into temporary sanctuaries. When German police began to round-up Jews in Denmark on the night of 1 October 1943, they had little success. The Danish resistance, assisted by many ordinary Danish citizens, organised a partly coordinated, partly spontaneous rescue operation. Within less than a month, some 8,000 refugees, mostly people who were considered Jews and their non-Jewish relatives, escaped to neutral Sweden, which accepted the Danish refugees. Meanwhile, the Germans managed to deport 472 Jews, most of whom were refugees from Germany or Eastern Europe, to the Theresienstadt ghetto. Dozens of Jews from Denmark died there before the end of the war. In late April 1945, German authorities handed the Danish prisoners over to the Swedish Red Cross. Virtually all the refugees returned to Denmark in 1945. In total, some 120 Danish Jews died during the Holocaust in Theresienstadt or during their escape from Denmark. One died in Auschwitz and one in Majdanek.\r\n\r\nDenmark has a long history of Roma presence and anti-Roma legislation. An immigration law from 1875 prohibited Roma [“Tatere”] from entering Denmark. It was not abolished until 1953. In 1934 a group of Norwegian Roma were not allowed into Denmark and as a result they were forced to travel to Belgium. This led to their deportation to Auschwitz-Birkenau. A controversial 1938 sociological and genetic study ordered by the Copenhagen welfare authorities assessed the number of Danish Roma at 700-800. During the German occupation no measures for registration or persecution of Roma were undertaken by the occupation authorities. \r\n"

The secret additional protocol of the 1939 Hitler-Stalin Pact assigned the country to the Soviet sphere of interest, which resulted in a military occupation by the Red Army in June 1940 and annexation as a Soviet Republic in July 1940. After the German invasion from July to October 1941, the territory of Estonia on 5 December 1941 officially became part of the civilian occupation administration of Reichskommissariat Ostland as Generalbezirk Estland. At the same time, it remained part of the operational zone of the Wehrmacht. The Red Army re-conquered the Estonian mainland in September 1944 and the islands in November 1944. Estonia’s independence was restored in August 1991.\r\n\r\nBefore the Second World War, Estonia had a total population of 1,126,413 people according to the 1934 census. Jews constituted a tiny minority of approximately 4,400 people who lived mostly in the cities of Tallinn, Tartu and Pärnu. During the Soviet occupation, about 400 Jews were deported as “unreliable or socially alien elements” to the Soviet interior. On the eve of the German occupation, some 2,000 to 2,500 Jews managed to flee from Estonia to the Soviet rear, either as part of the evacuation of industry and offices or on their own; some Jews were drafted into military service. About 1,000 Jews who remained were murdered by Einsatzgruppe A and the units subordinated to the Kommandeur der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD Estland and their local collaborators, mostly until the end of 1941. In the autumn of 1943 a network of Jewish forced labour camps was set up, mostly to exploit oil shale deposits. Up to 10,000 Jews from dismantled ghettos in Lithuania and, on occasion, from Latvia and Hungary were dispatched to these camps. Furthermore, there were transports of Jews from Germany and from the Theresienstadt /Terezín/ ghetto in the so-called Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. In the summer of 1944, a part of a transport from the Drancy camp in France was sent to camps in Estonia operated by the Security Police and SD. Male prisoners considered unfit for physical labour, as well as women and children, were usually executed upon arrival. Overall, over 7,500 of those deported to Estonia perished, mainly due to harsh labour, inhuman living conditions and targeted mass executions that accompanied the camp evacuations. Less than 1,000 Estonian Jews perished in the Holocaust, but Estonia became a killing site for thousands more Jews who had been deported from other countries.\r\n\r\nAccording to a December 1941 German census, there were 743 Roma in Estonia with a little more than half of them living in cities. Under German occupation, Roma were subject to arrest, imprisonment and summary execution and mass shootings often carried out under German order by local collaborators. Most of Estonia's Roma were murdered in Kalevi-Liiva near Tallinn. The exact number of Roma murdered is unknown. Estimates put the number of persecuted Roma between 800-1000 with only 5-6% of them surviving the war."

Under Franco’s rule, Spain stayed neutral throughout the Second World War, but did send volunteers, the so-called Blue Division, to fight alongside the Axis Powers against the Soviet Union. The Spanish regime was complicit in the persecution and deportation of nearly 15,000 Spanish Republican exiles from German-occupied France to concentration camps within the Reich. \r\n\r\nWhen the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, Spain had a total population of about 24.8 million people; approximately 6,000 of them were Jews. An additional 13,000 Jews lived in Spanish Morocco without Spanish citizenship. During the Civil War, many Jews left Spain, fearing the Fascists and their Axis allies. Antisemitism was an inherent part of the Franco Regime. While immigration became more complicated for the Jews, due to an antisemitic passage in the Frontier Law of 1939, approximately 20,000 to 30,000 refugees of diverse backgrounds, many Jewish, were able to leave Europe through Spain.

Having declared independence in December 1917, the country became involved in the Second World War by the Molotov-Ribbentrop Agreement of August 1939, which assigned Finland to the Soviet sphere of influence, and the resulting Soviet assault in November 1939. The ensuing “Winter War” was ended by the Finnish-Soviet Peace Treaty in March 1940 and cost Finland about ten percent of its territory, including the city of Vyborg (Viipuri). On 26 June 1941, the country joined Hitler’s war against the USSR to recoup the losses incurred the year before. After achieving its objectives, Finland did not wish to join in Nazi Germany's wider war aims and did not, for instance, participate in the German attack on Leningrad. However, Finland rejected a Soviet peace offer made in April 1944 and it was the Red Army’s offensive two months later which forced Finland to sign an armistice in September 1944. After this, Finnish troops forced the German military in the country to withdraw to still-occupied Norway. Finland formally declared war on Germany in March 1945.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War, Finland had a total population of approximately 3,695,000 inhabitants. There were about 2,000 Jews among them, most of them Finnish citizens. In addition, a few hundred foreign-born Jews had been admitted to the country as refugees in the 1930s. Between 1941 and 1944, the treatment of Jews in Finland depended to a large degree on their legal status: Finnish Jews had the same rights and obligations as their fellow citizens. Foreign Jews, on the other hand, were subjected to police surveillance and threatened with deportation even for minor infractions. Twelve Jewish refugees were handed over to the German authorities by the Finnish Ministry for Internal Affairs and the Security Police. More than 700 Jews were most at risk, as they were part of the 60,000 Soviet prisoners-of-war in Finnish captivity. As a result of Finnish-German Security Police co-operation, the Finnish Security Police and military authorities handed over 521 “undesirable” Soviet prisoners-of-war, including more than 50 Soviet Jews, to the German Security Police for execution. The Germans showed no acute interest, however, in the remaining Jews in Finnish custody. When Finland began to disentangle itself from the war in 1943, the country gradually relaxed its policy towards foreigners and prisoners-of-war. “Undesirable” prisoners were no longer handed over to the Germans and a settlement with the Swedish government was negotiated, providing for the transfer of Jewish refugees to Sweden.\r\n\r\nFinland's Roma population was estimated to be around 4,000 people in 1939. While no Finnish Roma were handed over to the Germans, the Roma community faced discrimination and hostility. The 1,500 Karelian Roma who had to leave after the \"Winter War\" between Finland and the Soviet Union 1939/1940 were not allowed to return between 1941 and 1944, unlike the rest of the Karelian population. Attempts to implement plans by the Finnish state to put all Roma in labour camps were unsuccessful. Some 300 Roma fought in the Finnish army which has contributed to a positive memory of the Second World War and a heightened sense of equality and community with the wider Finnish society. This has been encouraged by both Finland's Roma community and the Finnish state."

General de Gaulle, established a government-in-exile in London, Free France, which joined the Allies and supported the Resistance. According to the armistice, Germany de facto annexed the regions of Alsace and Lorraine, while the rest of France was principally divided into a small demilitarized Italian zone in the south east and two large parts: the Occupied Zone and the Free Zone. The first encapsulated Northern France and the Atlantic Coast and was placed under German military control. Southern France remained unoccupied and was placed under the control of a new French government, headed by Marshal Philippe Pétain. In response to the Allied landings in North Africa in November 1942, German and Italian forces also occupied the Southern Zone. When Italy attempted to surrender to the Allies in September 1943, the Germans took over the Italian zone of France. The liberation of France began with the Allied landings in Normandy on 6 June 1944. Two months later, on 25 August, the German forces in Paris surrendered.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1940, France had a total population of 40,690,000 inhabitants. Some 300,000 to 350,000 were Jewish, with 145,000 living in the Southern Zone. About half of the Jewish population were not French citizens, but Jews who had moved to France after the First World War or had arrived as Jewish refugees during the 1930s. Almost immediately after the occupation, Jews in both zones were subjected to a first wave of anti-Jewish measures. In the German-controlled zone, Jews were removed from their jobs, their freedom of movement was restricted, and many were arrested. At the same time, the Vichy government actively commenced persecuting Jews. In October 1940, it passed a set of anti-Jewish laws called the Statut des Juifs [Jewish Statute]. In March 1941, the Vichy authorities set up a General Commissariat for Jewish Affairs [Commissariat Général aux Questions Juives]. In June 1942, the Germans forced the Jews in the occupied zone to wear the Jewish badge for easy identification, began arresting large groups, and restricted the movements of the remaining community. The “round-ups” [“rafles”] were carried out by the French police in summer 1942. The most notable was the roundup of the Vélodrôme d'Hiver or Vél d’Hiv in Paris. There, about 13,000 Jews (men, women and children) were rounded up, and some 7,000 of them were jammed into the Vél d’Hiv in deplorable conditions. Many thousands of Jews were arrested and sent to transit camps, mostly to Drancy, Compiègne and Pithiviers, from where they were deported to Nazi-occupied Poland. The Vichy authorities also arrested and deported approximately 7,000 Jews from their zone in the summer of 1942. Altogether, 42,500 Jews were sent to Nazi-occupied Poland during 1942. Nearly one third of them came from unoccupied France. German authorities resumed transports of Jews from France in January 1943 and continued the deportations until August 1944. In total, approximately 80,000 Jews were deported from France. Some 70,000 were sent to Auschwitz, while the others were sent to Majdanek, Sobibor and, in smaller numbers, to Buchenwald. Among the deportees, only 2,000 survived. Others died in detention on French soil.\r\n\r\nIn 1939, it is estimated that there were around 40,000 \"nomades\" (e.g. Sinti/Manouches, Roma, Gitans, Yenish) living in France. Already on 6 April 1940, before the German occupation of France, the government ordered the arrest of \"nomades\" in camps. Others were put under house arrest. Discrimination and restrictions on freedom of movement intensified under German occupation. More than 30 detention camps existed during the Second World War in both the occupied and free zones of France, with approximately 6,500 Sinti and Roma interned. A lot of inmates tried to flee; a significant number of Sinti and Roma fought in the resistance movement. Some were deported to Germany and did not survive. Some of the detention camps existed until May 1946, when the government repealed the decree.\r\n\r\nNote: The former French colonies are discussed in country reports under their present-day name."

The Channel Islands were home to only a few dozen Jews. Anti-Jewish measures on the Islands were issued by the German military authorities in Paris and followed the timing of those in France. They were implemented by the German military administration with the assistance of local authorities. In both Guernsey and Jersey, antisemitic legislation was passed by the Royal Court. About ten Jews were deported. The Nazis operated a number of concentration and forced labour camps on the island of Alderney from January 1942 with approximately 5,000, mostly Eastern European inmates. About 890 of the prisoners were French Jewish forced labourers, at least 8 of whom died there. The United Kingdom had begun accepting refugees following the November Pogrom of 1938 when the British Government agreed to allow an unrestricted number of unaccompanied Jewish children to enter the country, a measure which remained in effect until the war broke out in September 1939. In total, approximately 65,000 Jewish refugees found shelter in the UK. British forces liberated concentration camps in northern Germany, including Neuengamme and Bergen-Belsen. \r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, there were an estimated 45,000 Roma in England, which was the majority of Roma in the United Kingdom.

With the Greek army defeated, the country remained under enemy occupation until October 1944. Greece was divided into three zones. Germany controlled parts of Greek Macedonia (including Thessaloniki), Thrace, Piraeus, and Crete. Bulgaria annexed Eastern Greek Macedonia and the rest of Thrace. Athens was jointly occupied by Germany and Italy. After Italy’s surrender in September 1943, all Italian-occupied regions came under German rule. The Red Army’s advance in late 1944 forced the Germans to withdraw from Greece. In October 1944, British troops entered Athens unopposed.\r\n\r\nIn 1941, Greece had a total population of approximately 7,370,000 inhabitants, up to 80,000 of whom were Jews. While there were Jewish communities in at least two dozen cities, the biggest one was in Thessaloniki, which totalled some 55,000 people. On 11 July 1942, all male Jews between 18 and 45 years old were gathered in one of the city’s squares and beaten and humiliated for hours. After their registration, thousands of them were subjected to forced labour. Three months later, after the payment of a huge ransom, they were released. In February 1943, the Jews were obliged to wear the Yellow Star and forced to move into two ghetto areas. Between March and August of that year, up to 46,000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where most of them were murdered upon arrival. In the Italian zone, the Jews lived in relative safety until the Italian surrender to the Allies in September 1943. After the Germans took control of the Italian zone, almost all its Jews were also deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. The Jews from the territories under Bulgarian administration were deported to Treblinka in March 1943 following a Bulgarian-German agreement signed a month earlier. In total, less than twenty percent of the Greek Jews survived the Holocaust, with the highest percentage of victims from Thessaloniki and the Bulgarian occupation zone.\r\n\r\nFor this country there are no sufficient findings on the history of Roma during the Second World War.

              "history": "The Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded by Germany, Italy and other Axis states on 6 April 1941. The country capitulated on 17 April and Germans, Italians, Hungarians and Bulgarians occupied and partitioned the country. On 10 April 1941 the Germans troops entered Zagreb, and the Independent State of Croatia [Nezavisna država Hrvatska, NDH] was proclaimed by the representatives of the Ustaša movement. The Axis powers sponsored the NDH’s expansion through the incorporation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the complete Eastern Srijem region (today part of the Republic of Serbia). Conversely, they immediately and systematically began to chip away at Croatian sovereignty: Italy occupied and eventually annexed parts of Dalmatia, Hungary annexed Međimurje on the northern tip of Croatia. Both German and Italian troops had more or less free reign in their respective zones of influence, which covered virtually the entire territory of the NDH. The NDH existed until the end of the Second World War in May 1945.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War 23,000 to 24,000 Jews lived in Croatia out of an estimated total population of 2,481,000 according to the 1931 census. The NDH authorities immediately began introducing anti-Jewish measures, many also anti-Roma and anti-Serb. As in Nazi Germany, the NDH government defined being Jewish in racial terms. Between April 1941 and October 1942, the NDH decreed at least 30 laws and regulations on the national level and many more on provincial and local levels that established the status of Jews in the new state, regulated the confiscation and redistribution of Jewish property and dismantled Jewish communities as well as other Jewish organisations. On 30 April 1941, it issued three anti-Jewish laws that defined who was Jewish and determined their legal status: the Legal Provision on Citizenship, the Legal Provision on Racial Origins, and the Legal Provision on the Protection of Aryan Blood and the Honour of the Croatian People. During May of 1941, the Ustaša began to conduct mass-arrests, deportations to concentration camps and the killing of members of Croatian Jewry. The NDH authorities established concentration and labour camps as well as death camps for interned Jews. There were numerous concentration camps in the territory of the NDH, the largest one among them being Jasenovac. Many Jews fled to the Italian-annexed and occupied zones of the country, where they were relatively safe until September of 1943, when Italy capitulated. Only around 4,000 to 5,000 Croatian Jews survived the Second World War.\r\n\r\nAccording to official data from 1931, around 15,000 Roma lived in territories that would be included in the newly proclaimed Independent State of Croatia in 1941. Estimates assume, however, that 30,000 Roma actually lived in this area during the Second World War. The policy towards Roma was based on racial laws and aimed at their genocidal extermination. From May 1942, Roma from the whole country were systematically deported to camps within the country, especially to the Jasenovac camp, where they were tortured and killed. Roma were also deported to camps in Nazi Germany (Auschwitz, Dachau). Part of the Roma from these territories were also interned in fascist camps in Italy. Roma were also victims of mass crimes by Chetniks (Serbian) and German military units and some Roma joined the anti-fascist partisan resistance movement. The first known Roma partisan military unit was founded in this area. It is estimated that almost the entire Roma community perished in the war, between 15,000 and 30,000. In the first post-war population census conducted in 1948, only 405 declared themselves as Roma in the territory of today's Croatia."

              "history": "Hungary fell increasingly under the influence of Germany as the Nazi regime consolidated itself during the 1930s. When Germany began to redraw national boundaries in Europe, Hungary was able to regain territory it had lost due to the 1920 Trianon Treaty, including southern Slovakia (1938) and Subcarpathian Rus (1939) after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, and Northern Transylvania from Romania (1940). In November 1940, Hungary joined the Tripartite Pact. In April 1941, it took part in the occupation of Yugoslavia, and annexed the Bačka, the Baranya triangle, the Medimurje and the Prekmurje regions. On 27 June 1941, Hungary declared war on the Soviet Union. After Germany’s defeat at Stalingrad and other battles in which Hungary lost tens of thousands of its soldiers, the Regent of Hungary, Miklós Horthy, initiated clandestine peace negotiations with the Western Allies. As a result, German troops occupied Hungary on 19 March 1944. However, Horthy was allowed to remain regent. Following a thwarted attempt to leave war, on 15 October 1944, Horthy was replaced by the fascist Arrow Cross government. The German occupiers were driven out of Hungary by the Red Army on 13 April 1945.\r\n\r\nAccording to the 1941 census, Hungary with its annexed territories had a total population of about 14 million, including 725,000 Jews, among them some 400,000 in Hungary proper, and tens of thousands of Christians who were considered Jewish by racist criteria. From 1938 onwards, anti-Jewish legislation effectively excluded the Jews from Hungarian society depriving them of many of their civil rights and economic opportunities. Jewish men were forced to perform unarmed military labour service in the Hungarian Army. Thousands of them perished on the Eastern front. Additionally, already in the summer of 1941, Hungarian authorities deported some 20,000 Jews, including refugees and aliens, but also Hungarian citizens. They were driven to the occupied Soviet territories, where most of them were killed by the German SS with Ukrainian auxiliaries near Kamianets-Podilskyi in Ukraine. In January 1942, Hungarian military units and gendarmes murdered about 3,500 local people, including some 700 Jews, in Novi Sad and in its vicinity, in the Bačka region.\r\n\r\nDespite serious casualties and the increasingly antisemitic political climate, most of the Hungarian Jews could live in relative physical safety until March, 1944. However, after the German invasion, a large part of Jewry in Hungary was murdered. Due to the active participation of the Hungarian government, public administration, and law enforcement, the German authorities were able to deport nearly all the Jews from the provinces, close to 440,000 people, over a period of only 56 days between 15 May and 9 July 1944. With the exception of some 15,000 people who were sent to labour camps near Vienna, all the deportees were taken to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where about 75-80% of them, mostly women, children and the elderly, were murdered in gas chambers upon arrival, the others were sent to various labour camps, mostly within the Reich.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Germans’ plans, the approximately 200,000 Jews of Budapest were next in line to be locked into ghettos and then deported. From the end of June 1944, they had to live in so-called “yellow star houses”, nearly two thousand designated buildings throughout the city. The Jews in Budapest were spared from deportation to Auschwitz due to the course of the war. The persecution of Jews was resumed on 15 October, when the Arrow Cross Party came to power. Armed party militias killed thousands of Jews in the streets of Budapest, and tens of thousands were drafted for forced labour to build fortifications at the south-eastern border of the Greater German Reich in Austria. The remaining Jews were forced to move to a sealed-off ghetto in early December, whereas a so-called international ghetto was established for Jews with passports or protective documents issued by embassies of neutral countries. On 18 January, the Red Army liberated the ghettos. In Budapest, some 150,000 Jews survived in the two ghettos and in hiding. Between 1941 and 1945, more than half a million people, that is, two thirds of the Jewish population of the wartime territory of Hungary, was murdered by the Nazis and their Hungarian collaborators, among them 260,000 Jews from interwar Hungary.\r\n\r\nThe number of Roma living in the wartime territory of Hungary (1941-1944) is estimated at up to 200,000. Roma communities faced discrimination in the form of raids and forced labour from 1929 onwards. Anti-Roma state violence intensified after the takeover of the pro-Nazi Arrow Cross Party on October 15, 1944. From early November 1944 on, the Hungarian public administration and the gendarmerie rounded up Roma from Western Hungary, the vicinity of Budapest, and the annexed former Czechoslovak territories in the collection camp in the Star Fort of Komárom, where they were detained in inhumane conditions. Adults and youth declared able to work were deported to various concentration camps in Germany, including Dachau, Buchenwald, Bergen-Belsen, Mauthausen, and Ravensbrück. Many died or were permanently injured by cruel treatment and forced labour. While family members who remained in the Star Fort were later released to go home, plenty, especially the young and the elderly, perished from hunger or froze to death in Komárom or on their way back. From the autumn of 1944 to the spring of 1945, several atrocities and mass executions occurred throughout the country, leading to the deaths of hundreds of Hungarian Roma, including women and children. The number of identified victims of the Roma genocide in Hungary is about 1500, but the total death toll is still subject to ongoing research and debate."

              "history": "In March 1919, Benito Mussolini founded a movement called “Fasci di combattimento”, which became the Partito Nazionale Fascista (PNF) in November 1921. On 28 October 1922 he organised the “March on Rome”, following which King Vittorio Emanuele III of Savoy invited him to form a new government. Mussolini transformed the government into a dictatorship and then into a totalitarian state. After Italy left the League of Nations in 1937, the “Rome-Berlin Axis”, proclaimed in 1936, developed into a closer military alliance, the “Pact of Steel”, in 1939. Having pursued an expansionist foreign policy in the Mediterranean and in Africa throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, the Kingdom of Italy entered the war alongside Germany on 10 June 1940. Its assault on Greece in October 1940 and the military struggles in the Balkans and in North Africa triggered German interventions. In turn, Italy joined Germany’s invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. On 10 July 1943 the Allies, who had already occupied the Italian colonies in Africa (Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Libya), landed in Sicily. Two weeks later, on 25 July, the king and the Gran Consiglio del Fascismo toppled Mussolini, who was arrested. In early September, the new Italian leadership signed a separate peace agreement with the Allies. At this point, Italy's empire still encompassed the Dodecanese Islands (centred on Rhodes, today part of Greece), and extended to Greater Albania, Montenegro, and parts of Dalmatia (today part of Croatia) and Slovenia. However, the Allies were already in the process of invading southern Italy. This caused Germany to step in and occupy the remaining parts of Italy the Allies had not yet conquered. German forces also took over the Italian zones of occupation in Yugoslavia, Greece, and France. Parts of northern Italy were de facto annexed by the German Reich, designated as the Operationszonen Alpenvorland and Adriatisches Küstenland. While the king and his government fled south, Mussolini was freed from prison by SS paratroopers and was allowed to set up the Italian Social Republic [Repubblica Sociale Italiana, RSI] in Salò, northern Italy. The war front advanced very slowly: Rome was liberated in June 1944, Milan and the North in April 1945, when German forces withdrew from Italy altogether.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Italy had a total population of approximately 42 million people (not including the colonies). Its Jewish community, one of the oldest and most integrated in Europe, numbered about 47,000 people. Unlike the Nazi party, the PNF did not include anti-Judaism in its Statute until 1938, and there were Jews who joined the PNF. Notwithstanding this fact, Mussolini veered towards public and generalised anti-Jewish action halfway through the 1930s. In the autumn of 1938, this translated into the implementation of harsh anti-Jewish legislation based on biological racism resembling the German Nuremberg Laws. Many adults were coerced into forced labour (1942) and foreign Jews saw almost all their residence permits cancelled (1938); those who stayed on were later (1940) interned in the camp at Ferramonti and in other smaller camps. Still, between 1938 and 1943 there was no systematic state violence against Jews and they were not deported. Apart from some limited exceptions, Italian authorities in the occupied territories did not grant any requests by the Croatian Ustasha or the Germans to hand over Jews. When the Germans occupied Italy in 1943, the situation of the Jews in the central and northern half part of Italy worsened drastically. Jews were arrested by both the German and Italian police and gathered in provincial camps that were situated in various buildings or in town jails; from there they were transferred to the national internment camp, first at Fossoli, then at Bolzano. Here, the German police organised their deportation. The vast majority of deportees was sent to Auschwitz. The Jews of Operationszone Adriatisches Küstenland were arrested directly by the Germans and interned in the Risiera di San Sabba in Trieste, from where they were deported directly to Auschwitz. Over 300 Jews died in massacres in various places and of the approximately 7,500 deported Jews, a little over 800 survived. Some thousand Jews took part in the Resistance. The remaining 30,000 or more lived in hiding, were able to reach Switzerland or the already liberated South. Overall, about 7,000 Jews from Italy perished during the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nAfter the First World War, there were some thousands of Roma and Sinti living in the Kingdom of Italy. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Fascist government issued various persecutory measures to prevent the immigration of Sinti and Roma. While the escalation of anti-Roma governmental measures (a procedural escalation) began as early as the end of 1937, the entry of Italy into the war in June 1940 led to a further series of measures such as surveillance and ultimately the internment of civilians who were considered as a \"threat to the state\", among them Sinti and Roma. They were deported by the Italian police to camps within Italy, sent into banishment or put under police surveillance. After the German occupation in September 1943, some Sinti and Roma were deported by the German police."

After a military coup attempt in 1936, the Japanese military consolidated its control over the political system. In 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War began. Japan occupied large parts of Eastern China. Japan's stated war aim was to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, a vast pan-Asian union under Japanese domination. Japan, Germany and Italy formed the Tripartite Pact in September 1940, which is the basis for the Axis. On 7 December 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy launched a surprise attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This brought the US into the Second World War. Japan then successfully invaded the Asian colonies of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, having already penetrated French Indochina in 1940-1941. The tide began to turn against Japan following the Battle of Midway in June 1942. The Japanese military was responsible for war crimes against prisoners of war and civilians. On 6 August 1945, the US dropped an atomic bomb over Hiroshima. On 8/9 August, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and invaded Manchuria, and a day later Nagasaki was struck by a second atomic bomb. The unconditional surrender of Japan was communicated to the Allies on 14 August. \r\n\r\nWith a population of slightly over 70,000,000 in 1939, the Empire of Japan only had a small Jewish presence. The Russian Jewish community in Kobe was the largest (about 40 families in 1941). During the Second World War, Japan was initially regarded as a safe transit country and, for a limited number, a safe country of refuge, despite being an ally of Germany. Most of the German and Eastern European refugees were sent on to Shanghai in the Japanese-occupied part of China. Between 1938 and 1941, approximately 20,000 European Jewish refugees joined the city’s small population of Bagdadi and Russian Jews, and in 1943, were ordered by the Japanese authorities to relocate to one small section of the city."

              "history": "Most of Lithuania had been a part of the Russian Empire until it declared independence in February 1918. The city of Klaipėda (Memel), occupied by Lithuanian troops in 1923, had to be handed back to the German Reich in March 1939. The secret additional protocol to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 assigned Lithuania to the German sphere of interest, recognising Lithuania’s interest in the Vilnius area, which had been a part of Poland since the end of the First World War. As a result, Vilnius and its surrounding area came under Lithuanian sovereignty in October 1939. Some five weeks later, the German-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation reassigned Lithuania to the Soviet sphere of influence, and on 15 June 1940 the Red Army entered Lithuania. One month later, the country was proclaimed a Soviet Republic. When German troops invaded the USSR on 22 June 1941, Lithuania passed under a German civilian administration and became a Generalbezirk of the Reichskommissariat Ostland. Lithuania was re-conquered by the Red Army from German rule between July 1944 and January 1945. Lithuania’s independence was re-proclaimed in 1990.\r\n\r\nIn 1939, Lithuania had a total population of some 2,900,000 people. On the eve of the German invasion, there were about 220,000 Jews among them, including approximately 80,000 Jews from the Vilnius area and some 15,000 Jewish refugees who had fled from the German-occupied western parts of Poland. Furthermore, among other refugees some 6,000 Jews left the Klaipėda region after March 1939. Immediately after the German invasion began, the Jews were attacked in pogroms. The systematic mass murder of Lithuania’s Jews began in the summer of 1941. By the end of 1941, nearly 180,000 Lithuanian Jews had been murdered. The remaining 40,000 Jews were mostly classified as fit for work and interned in four ghettos – Vilnius (18,000), Kaunas (16,000), Šiauliai (4,700) and Švenčionys (2,000) – or in forced labour camps. There were no mass murders in Lithuania in the period from early 1942 to mid-1943, but individual killings did occur. Then, in spring 1943, the Švenčionys and Ašmenos ghettos were liquidated and more than 4,000 inmates from both ghettos were murdered in Paneriai. During the autumn of 1943, the Vilnius ghetto was also liquidated. At the same time, the Kaunas and Šiauliai ghettos became concentration camps under the command of the SS. In the process, some 11,000 Jews from the Vilnius ghetto deemed capable of work were deported to concentration camps in Estonia and Latvia, while 3,500 women and children were sent to extermination camps in Poland. When the Germans retreated and liquidated the Kaunas ghetto in the summer of 1944, some 1,000 Jews were killed then and there, while approximately 6-7,000 were sent to Dachau and Stutthof. At the same time, a few thousand more were sent from Šiauliai to Stutthof. Overall, about 200,000 Lithuanian Jews perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nBefore World War II, about 1,500 Roma lived in Lithuania. This number does not cover the Vilnius region that was part of the Second Polish Republic until 1939. Under German occupation, Roma were killed in the local fields and forests, often without any official record. First mass killings took place along the Belarusian border in the early months of the occupation, intensifying in 1942. Further executions took place at the Pravieniškės forced labor camp near Kaunas in the summer of 1943 and between May and June 1944. Some Roma managed to flee from Pravieniškės during pit extraction works and joined the Soviet partisan movement in the north-west of Belarus.  At least 134 Roma were killed at the Paneriai mass extermination site near Vilnius in 1942 and in the spring of 1944. Many Roma were imprisoned in forced labour camps such as Pabradė, Ežerėlis, and Raudonplynė, and later hundreds were deported to Germany and occupied territories. Overall, at least 500 Lithuanian Roma were murdered during the Nazi occupation."

The Grand Duchess of Luxembourg and her government fled to France and Portugal and, eventually, to Great Britain. In August 1940, a German civilian government was established under the leadership of the adjoining German Gau of Koblenz-Trier (from January 1941 Gau Moselland). In August 1942, Germany introduced compulsory military service for young Luxembourgers and bestowed German citizenship on collaborators (measures which caused a general strike in the country). The country was liberated by the Allies on 9 September 1944.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War, Luxembourg had a total population of some 300,000 inhabitants. Around 3,900 of them were Jews. Most were refugees who had arrived since Hitler's rise to power in 1933. From September 1940 to October 1941, approximately 3,000 Jews left Luxembourg, seeking refuge in France or Belgium. Some 700 were able to leave the German-controlled countries of Europe. By October 1941, most of the remaining Jews were old, poor or sick. In September 1940, the administration applied the Nuremberg Laws to Luxembourg and began to confiscate Jewish property. In July 1941, the Jews of Luxembourg were ordered to wear a yellow armband on their left arm and in October 1941 the Jewish badge. Many were placed in a ghetto-like camp, which soon became the assembly point in Luxembourg for deportations to the east. That same month, the deportations began; on 16 October, 322 Jews were sent to the ghetto of Litzmannstadt . Overall, 662 Jews were deported in seven transports, the last of which left in June 1943. Only 45 are known to have survived. Many were sent directly to extermination camps (Auschwitz) or passed through Theresienstadt. Of the 3,900 Jews who lived in Luxembourg before the war, 1,200 perished.\r\n\r\nSince the early 18th century, a very small group of Sinti and Roma lived in Luxembourg. The Grand Duchy systematically prevented members of the minority from entering the country, so that only a few families were living there at the beginning of the Second World War. In recent research, the names of just over 20 Sinti and Roma who were deported from German-occupied Luxembourg or as Luxembourg nationals and some of whom were murdered were identified."

              "history": "Latvia had been part of the Russian Empire until the country declared independence on 18 November 1918. The secret additional protocol to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 assigned Latvia to the Soviet sphere of interest, and in June 1940, the Red Army entered Latvian territory. One month later, Latvia was proclaimed a Soviet Republic. By 10 July 1941, weeks after the German attack on the USSR, all of Latvia was under German occupation. Latvia was subjected to a German civilian administration as Generalbezirk Lettland of the Reichskommissariat Ostland. The Red Army began re-conquering Latvia in the summer of 1944, and reached the country’s capital, Riga, in October 1944. The westernmost parts of Latvia were reclaimed by the Soviet Union only in May 1945. Latvia’s independence was restored on 4 May 1990.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Latvia had a total population of 1,995,000 people, including some 92,000 Jews. Almost half of them lived in Riga, but there were also large communities in Daugavpils and Liepaja. During the Soviet occupation, about 1,800 Jews were deported to Siberia by the Soviet secret police. When the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 and pushed through Latvia, only about 14,500 to 15,000 Jews managed to escape eastwards. \r\nAround 75,000 Jews remained in Latvia under German occupation. German attacks on the Jews quickly escalated to mass murder. Most of the Latvian Jews who lived outside the main urban centres were murdered in July and August 1941. Between August and December 1941, the majority of the inmates of the Daugavpils and Riga Ghettos were murdered. By 1 January 1942, only some 9,000 Jews were still alive, mainly in the ghettos of Riga and Daugavpils, but also in Liepaja, where the ghetto had only been established in July 1942, or in concentration camps. About 25,000 Jews from Central Europe (mostly from Germany, Austria and Bohemia) were deported to the Riga ghetto. By 1943 most of the Jews on Latvian territory were dead. Survivors of the Riga ghetto were first sent to the Kaiserwald concentration camp and then transferred to Stutthof in September 1944. Overall, about 74,000 Latvian Jews perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nAccording to a census conducted in 1935, 3,839 Roma lived in Latvia. The German occupiers' policy towards Roma left those responsible a great deal of leeway, which led to murders, but also to sparing from persecution. The first murder took place on 5 December 1941, when the German security police shot 100 Roma from Liepāja (German Libau). More than a dozen shootings of Roma are known to have taken place in 1942 and 1943; in Jelgava (German Mitau) alone, 810 Roma were shot. Overall, half of all Roma living in Latvia were murdered by the German security and police forces, as well as local auxiliary forces. "

              "history": "Until 1918, Bessarabia (most of which is part of Moldova today) was part of the Russian Empire. Before the Second World War, most of present-day Moldova was part of the Romanian region of Bessarabia, while a slim strip of land east of the Dniester River was part of the Moldavian Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic (MASSR) within Soviet Ukraine. According to the secret addenda to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939, Bessarabia was, among other regions, assigned to the Soviet zone of influence. On 28 June 1940, Romania was forced to hand over Bessarabia to the Soviet Union. The new Moldavian Socialist Soviet Republic (MSSR) within the USSR was formed on 2 August 1940 mostly from six counties of formerly Romanian Bessarabia and six raions (regions) of the former MASSR. After the German attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Germany's ally Romania regained its former region of Bessarabia until the Red Army recaptured these territories on 24 August 1944. The recaptured territories thus remained within the USSR as one of the union republics (MSSR) until 1991. When the Soviet Union dissolved, the Republic of Moldova declared independence in 1991.\r\n\r\nIn 1940, the territories of today’s Moldova had an estimated total population of 2,468,000 people. Some 270,000 to 280,000 of them were Jews. The Soviets deported about 8,000 Jews as “class-hostile elements” to remote areas of the USSR and tens of thousands of Jews managed to escape or were evacuated to the east when the German-Romanian invasion began in July 1941. Romanian and German units began the mass extermination of the Moldovan Jews. The surviving Jews were deported to Transnistria, the area between the Dnister and Bug rivers and around Odessa given over to Romanian occupation. Thousands died in the process or later on in transit camps. Once there, some were killed in mass shootings, but many more died from disease, hunger and overwork in the ghettos and camps. Most of the Jews in the Moldovan districts in Transnistria perished in a similar fashion. Some relief sent by Romanian Jewish aid organizations reached the survivors of the deportations after the Romanian dictator Antonescu stopped his policies of extermination in 1942/1943. Overall, around 150,000 Jews from Moldova perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nRoma lived in the region of Moldova for centuries where they were subject to enslavement until the mid-nineteenth century. The exact number of Roma living in the territory of present-day Moldova during the Second World War is not known. Around 2,200 Roma were deported from Bessarabia to Transnistria in the autumn of 1942. How many of them survived is also not known. "

              "history": "In 1918, what is now North Macedonia became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. After the German conquest of Yugoslavia in April 1941, North Macedonia was divided between the occupying forces of Germany (in the north), Bulgaria (in the centre and east), and Italian-controlled Albania (in the west). After Italy’s capitulation in September 1943, a portion of western Vardar Macedonia briefly came under partisan control before German forces captured the territory. In September 1944, the Germans attempted to establish an Independent State of Macedonia, but without substantial military support, it ceased to exist in November 1944. Shortly afterwards, North Macedonia was declared a state-member of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia (FNRJ), later the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). In 1991, it declared independence as the Republic of Macedonia. In 2019, it was renamed North Macedonia. \r\n\r\nBefore the Second World War, approximately 12,000 Jews lived in North Macedonia. Towards the end of 1941, authorities in the Bulgarian-occupied territories passed laws prohibiting Jews from engaging in commerce. In 1943, the Bulgarians deported thousands of Jews from the regions they controlled in North Macedonia (and Greece) at the behest of the Germans. Once they were handed over to the Nazi German authorities, they were taken to Treblinka II where they were murdered in the gas chambers upon their arrival. 7,144 Jews from North Macedonia perished in this way. After the war, there were approximately 200 surviving Jews left in North Macedonia.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War, in the area of today's North Macedonia lived the largest Roma community in Yugoslavia (officially about 24,000). Roma worked as craftsmen and traders and were of Muslim or Orthodox faith. The occupying authorities - Bulgaria and Albania under Italian control and from September 1944 Germany alone - did not implement a genocidal policy towards the Roma, but there are cases of mass crimes committed against them. Roma were also used as forced labourers. The Bulgarian occupation authorities legally discriminated against Roma, preventing them from marrying non-Roma. Part of the Roma escaped the violence and persecution by fleeing into the forests and joining the anti-fascist partisan resistance movement."

The Dutch army surrendered four days later, and Queen Wilhelmina fled to Great Britain, where she set up a government-in-exile. The heads of the government ministries stayed behind, forming a substitute cabinet. Hitler soon ordered the establishment of a German civilian administration, led by Reich Commissioner Arthur Seyss-Inquart. The Allies entered the south of the country in the autumn of 1944; the north was liberated more than six months later, in the spring of 1945.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the occupation, the Netherlands had a total population of about 9 million inhabitants. About 160,000 of them were Jewish, roughly half of which lived in Amsterdam. Some 22,000, including 15,000 refugees from Germany and Austria, were of foreign nationality. In the autumn of 1940, a series of anti-Jewish measures began. In mid-February 1941, the German occupier set up a Jewish Council [“Joodse Raad”]. On 25 February 1941, a general strike broke out to protest against the German occupier. In January 1942 the Germans opened forced labour camps, and charged the Joodse Raad with finding workers to fill ever-increasing labour quotas. The same month they began removing the Jews from the provinces and concentrating them in Amsterdam. In March, the German administration started confiscating Jewish property. A month later the Jews were ordered to wear the yellow Star of David. Deportations began in mid-July 1942 and lasted through September 1944. Jews were taken to the transit camps Westerbork and Vught, and from there mostly to Auschwitz. While some 25,000 Dutch Jews managed to go into hiding after being ordered to report for forced labour or deportation, about one-third of them were eventually discovered by the Germans. All in all, less than 25 percent of Dutch Jewry survived the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nSinti have lived in the Netherlands since the Middle Ages, while Roma arrived in the early 19th century. In the 1930 census, some 11,000 ‘travellers’ were registered, only a few hundred of whom were Sinti or Roma. Under German occupation, strict measures against \"woonwagenbewoners\" were carried out and some collection camps were installed. During a nationwide round-up on 16 May 1944, 578 Sinti, Roma and travellers were interned in Westerbork camp. After a selection, 245 Sinti and Roma were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Only 31 of them survived the war."

King Haakon VII and the government escaped to London, where they established a government-in-exile. The Germans appointed a civilian Reich Commissioner of occupied Norway, Josef Terboven. On 25 September 1940 the commissioner banned all political parties, except Nasjonal Samling, and in February 1942 set up a collaborationist government under Nasjonal Samling leader Vidkun Quisling which lasted until the liberation in May 1945.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the invasion, Norway had a total population of about 3 million people. Approximately 2,100 of them were Jews, including some 300-400 refugees from Germany and Austria. As the Germans prepared to invade the Soviet Union in early 1941, more and more Jews in Norway were arrested and incarcerated. In June 1941, all Jews in northern Norway were arrested. By early 1942, identity papers held by Jews had to be stamped with the letter “J”, and all Jews had to fill in a “registration form for Jews”. The fatal blow against Norwegian Jewry was struck by Quisling and Terboven in the autumn of 1942; in early October, all Jewish men in Trondheim were rounded up and on 26 and 27 October the Jewish men of Oslo were arrested by Norwegian police and paramilitary formations. A month later, the rest of Oslo's Jews were arrested by the Norwegian police and Norwegian Germanic SS units. Jewish property was confiscated. Some Jews were warned off by Norwegian policemen and members of the underground and managed to escape. Of the 772 Jews who had been arrested and deported to Auschwitz via Germany, only 34 survived and returned to Norway after the war. In Norway itself, 23 Jews died at the hands of the Nazis. About sixty percent of the Jewish population was able to escape to Sweden with the help of the Norwegian underground. Overall, 765 Jews from Norway perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nA “Gypsy clause” [“sigøynerparagrafen”] in the immigration law, practically denying the presence of Roma in Norway, had been introduced in 1927. It was not abolished until 1956. When Nazi Germany invaded Norway in 1940, the local authorities had already forced most of the small Norwegian Roma minority out of the country. Subsequently, Norwegian Roma were registered, stripped of their citizenships, expelled and denied reentry to the country. When the Second World War broke out, these persons lived as stateless foreigners on the European continent, primarily residing in Belgium and France. In 1943 and 1944, German and local police arrested and deported 66 Norwegian Roma from occupied Belgium to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Only four of them survived the war. In occupied Norway, in 1942, individuals within the Norwegian government began to discuss plans to establish Roma labor camps as well as forced sterilization. A registry of Roma was never conducted and any plans were halted by the Soviet invasion in 1944."

              "history": "After 123 years of foreign rule by the Russian Empire, the Habsburg Monarchy and Prussia/Germany, Poland was reconstituted as an independent, multi-ethnic republic in November 1918. Helped by the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, and occupied the Western regions of the country. On 17 September, Soviet troops followed suit and marched into the Eastern parts of Poland, which were annexed to the Byelorussian and Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republics. The Vilnius (Wilno) area, on the other hand, became part of still-sovereign Lithuania. Germany split her newly conquered territories into areas that were incorporated into the Reich [“eingegliederte Gebiete”], and the German administered General Government in central Poland. Meanwhile, the Polish government, which had first been evacuated to Romania and France, set itself up in London and organized underground representation within occupied Poland, thus keeping in touch with resistance organizations within the country. When Germany turned on its Soviet ally and attacked the USSR in June 1941, Eastern Poland (most of which is part of present-day Belarus, Lithuania and Ukraine) fell under German occupation as well; the District of Galicia was attached to the General Government in August 1941. Nazi occupation in Poland was ended by the Red Army, first east of the Vistula River in the summer of 1944, then in the rest of the country in early 1945.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War, the Polish Republic had an estimated total population of 35 million inhabitants. Some 3,500,000 of them were Jews. Within weeks of the invasion, about two million Polish Jews came under German occupation. Individual murders by German soldiers were not uncommon during the early days of the war and discrimination against the Jewish population in general began immediately. Jewish property was confiscated, synagogues were demolished or devastated. Jews were forced to wear badges or armbands identifying them as Jews and were gradually confined in ghettos throughout the country. By early 1941, almost half a million people had been packed into the Warsaw ghetto alone where many would die as a result of the terrible living conditions there. In western Poland, which had been annexed immediately to the German Reich, and the western part of the Warsaw region, the Jewish population was expelled further east or transferred into larger ghettos (principally Warsaw and Łódź). In June 1941, the mass extermination of Jews began in Eastern Poland. From December 1941, Jews were systematically murdered in the parts of Poland which had been under German occupation since 1939. The first extermination centre was established in Chełmno [Kulmhof], north of Łódź. Its victims were not only Polish Jews from the regions annexed to the Reich, but also German, Austrian and Czech Jews who had previously been deported to the Litzmannstadt ghetto. Within the framework of Operation Reinhardt, the German authorities established extermination centres (Bełżec, Sobibór and Treblinka) aimed at the extermination of the whole Jewish population of the General Government. The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in spring 1943 was crushed by the Germans and the ghetto itself destroyed. Some Jews were sent to the Lublin-Majdanek and Auschwitz concentration camps, where the majority were murdered. Jews from other European countries were also deported to these camps to be killed. While Operation Reinhardt ended in 1943, mass murder did not. The gas chambers in the concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau operated until 1944. The inhabitants of ghettos which had so far been spared found their end here: Jews from the Białystok and the Zagłębie regions were killed in 1943, those from Litzmannstadt in 1944. At the same time, Jews were brought to Auschwitz from various countries occupied or dominated by Germany, for example Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, Hungary and the Netherlands. They were submitted to selection: the able-bodied were sent to the concentration camps, the others (including the children) were murdered on the spot. The last Jewish victims of Nazi mass murder in Poland were the concentration camp inmates, who died from exhaustion or were shot during the evacuation of the camps (during the so-called Death Marches, for instance from Auschwitz and Stutthof). Soviet Army troops were the first to approach a major Nazi camp in Poland at Majdanek in July 1944 and to overrun the previously dismantled death camp sites of Bełżec, Sobibór and Treblinka. In January 1945, they liberated Auschwitz. About 3 million Jews from within the pre-war borders of Poland did not survive the war (two thirds of whom died in the territory of present-day Poland). Approximately 13% of the Polish Jewish pre-war population survived the war, mostly as refugees or deportees in the unoccupied parts of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nPoland had a population of approximately 50,000 Roma before the war. Almost immediately after the occupation, Polish Roma became subject to pogroms and mass shootings. There are approximately 180 sites of murder that have been identified such as the killing of the Roma of Szczurowa. Local collaborators often participated in the mass killings. Since May 1940 2,500 Sinti and Roma from Germany were put into camps and ghettos in the General Government. Sinti and Roma on Polish territory were deported to concentration and extermination camps like Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka or Majdanek. It is estimated that 35,000 Roma were killed during the war."

About 80,000 to 100,000 Jews and other refugees were able to flee Nazi-controlled Europe via Lisbon, which was the only neutral transatlantic harbour left in Western Europe after the occupation of France in June 1940. Staying in Portugal, however, was not an option, since the country’s government allowed Jews to enter on the condition that they would only use Portugal as a transit point. Various rescue projects were coordinated from the country, such as the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) – a US-based Quaker aid society – and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee which reopened its European office in Lisbon in 1940. Several Portuguese Jewish expatriate citizens were incarcerated in the so-called “neutrals’ camps” [“Neutralenlager”] in Germany.\r\n\r\nFor this country there are no sufficient findings on the history of Roma during the Second World War.

King Carol II was forced to abdicate in September 1940. In his place, General Ion Antonescu formed a government with the far-right Legionary Movement (also known as the Iron Guard party), proclaiming the National Legionary State. It lasted until January 1941, when Antonescu suppressed a coup of the Legionary Movement and forced it out of government. On 23 November 1940, Romania officially joined the Axis alliance. Romania participated in the German invasion of the Soviet Union in July 1941. Subsequently, Romania regained Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia and also administered its own zone of occupation in Soviet territory in Transnistria. The Antonescu regime was overthrown on 23 August 1944, as Soviet troops began entering the country from the east. Romania declared war on Germany in late August that same year and went on to fight alongside the Red Army.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War, Romania had a total population of about 19 million people. Approximately 760,000 of them were Jews, which meant Romania had the third largest Jewish population in Europe after Poland and the Soviet Union. In the summer and autumn of 1940, the annexation of Romanian territory by the Soviet Union, Hungary and Bulgaria lowered the Jewish population of Romania to less than 330,000. Long before Antonescu’s coup, antisemitism had been on the rise in Romania, especially in the eastern territories. The situation worsened with the rise of popular far-right movements. Pogroms and mass shootings took place in the summer of 1940, in the context of the Romanian army’s retreat from territories lost to the Soviet Union, with 400 Jews shot in Galați and 50 in Dorohoi. Another wave of antisemitic violence was recorded when the Legionary Movement was in power. After the defeat of the Legionary Movement's coup attempt, Ion Antonescu introduced systematic antisemitic measures. With the onset of the attack against the Soviet Union, Romanian authorities and Nazi Germany committed mass murder of Jews in northeastern Romania, Bessarabia, Bukovina, and Transnistria. On 29 June 1941, in the city of Iași, about 13,000 Jews were killed in an organised massacre by the Romanian authorities as well as during the subsequent deportations. In the summer of 1941, Romanian and German units, including Einsatzgruppe D, killed tens of thousands of Jews in Bukovina and Bessarabia (territories regained from the Soviet Union). Antonescu ordered the banishment of the approximately 150,000 remaining Jews to Transnistria. Thousands died on the way, others were systematically executed by Romanian gendarmes, Ukrainian militias and German paramilitaries after they arrived in Transnistria. In September 1943, only approximately 50,000 were still alive in the “colonies”, ghettos and concentration camps there. Most of the Ukrainian Jews native to Transnistria, including those of Odesa, were killed by Romanian and Ethnic German [“Volksdeutsche”] units between October 1941 and March 1942. In the summer of 1942, Antonescu began to back away from his extermination policy and mass deportations to Belzec were canceled. While emigration was now emphasized, no significant opportunities materialized during the course of the war. More than 280,000 Jews were murdered or died during the Holocaust in Romania and the territories under its control. Additionally, 135,000 Jews from Northern Transylvania, who were under Hungarian rule between 1940 and 1944, perished.\r\n\r\nAccording to a 1930 census there were 262,501 people who considered themselves to be of Roma descent. On May 25, 1942 Marshall Antonescu ordered a census of Roma in order to organize a deportation to Transnistria. Approximately 25,000 Roma were deported to around 100 locations in Transnistria, where about 11,000 of them died."

              "history": "An internationally recognised independent state since 1878, Serbia joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918, which then became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. In April 1941, when Germany’s twelve-day campaign against Yugoslavia led to its partition between the Axis powers and their allies, the Yugoslav government was evacuated to London. Following the capitulation, most of Serbia’s present-day territory was administered by the German military under the “Militärbefehlshaber Serbien” in Belgrade. The rest of the territory was annexed by neighbouring countries: northern Bačka by Hungary; some south-east areas by Bulgaria, the south-west areas by Italian-controlled Albania; and the north-west Syrmia region by the Independent State of Croatia [Nezavisna Država Hrvatska], which had been formed on 10 April 1941. The German occupiers were driven out of the Yugoslav capital Belgrade by the Red Army and local Communist partisan units in October 1944. Serbia then became one of six republics within the post-war Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. When Yugoslavia dissolved during the 1990s, Serbia became an independent state again.\r\n\r\nIn 1941, about 33,500 Jews lived in Serbia, among them some 16,000 lived in the German occupied areas of Serbia, out of a population of about 3,810,000. Soon, the new authorities issued anti-Jewish laws. Those considered Jews were forced to wear the Jewish badge, expelled from certain professions and restricted to living in certain areas. By the summer of 1941, all Jewish men between the ages of 16 and 60 were rounded up for forced labour. Jews also fell victim to German reprisals against the local resistance movement. Notably, the German military authorities threatened to retaliate by executing 50 Serbian hostages for every German injured and 100 for every German soldier killed; the Germans met their quota by executing Jews, hoping to avoid antagonising the gentile local population any further. By early autumn 1941, most of the Jewish men of Serbia had been imprisoned in local concentration camps, and mass executions began. By December, the majority of Jewish men, about 5,000 people, had been killed. Exceptions were made for those who were needed for forced labour. At the same time, about 8,000 Jewish women, children and elderly people were sent to a fairground which had been turned into an internment camp at Sajmište near Belgrade. From March to May 1942, more than 6,000 inmates were killed in gas vans, while another 1,200 died of exposure or starvation. By the summer of 1942, only a very few Jews were left in Serbia, surviving either by hiding or by joining the Partisans. In total, about 14,500 Jews were murdered in the German-controlled part of Serbia during the war.\r\n\r\nIn the Bulgarian-occupied zone of Serbia—Macedonia and southeast Serbia—Jews were arrested in 1943 and deported to the Treblinka death camp. In the Hungarian-occupied part of Serbia, Jews were among the victims of the Hungarian killings at Novi Sad in January 1942. In the Albanian-occupied area of Serbia, the Germans, supported by an Albanian SS-Division, arrested Jews from Kosovo and Jewish refugees from other parts of Yugoslavia. They were sent to the Sajmište camp and one month later to Bergen-Belsen. In the entirety of present-day Serbia, some 27,000 Jews out of about 33,500 (over 80%) perished.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to estimate the number of Roma in German-occupied Serbia. According to the 1931 census, 30,000 Roma lived in Serbia (excluding Kosovo, Metohia and Vojvodina). Shortly after the occupation German authorities enacted anti-Roma legal racist provisions (banned the performance of certain jobs) and deported Roma. They were deported to camps such as Banjica and Sajmište in the Belgrade area or in the concentration camp known as “Red Cross” in Niš, where they were tortured and killed. One of the places of mass executions of Roma was in the area of ​​the village of Jabuka, near Pancevo. Roma were victims of German mass shootings of civilians as a reprisal for the killing of German soldiers. In August 1942, German occupation authorities reported that the “Gypsy question” had been “solved” in Serbia. Roma were also victims of Chetnik military units and the Hungarian occupation authorities, and some of them joined the anti-fascist partisan movement. While the number of victims of the shootings in 1941 and early 1942 can be estimated at around 2,500, there are no reliable figures for the total number of Roma victims in German occupied Serbia (which is in some cases estimated at 20,000). In the first post-war population census conducted in 1948 in the territory of today's Serbia (including the areas of Vojvodina, Kosovo and Metohija) 52,181 Roma were enumerated."

              "history": "When Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, its armies advanced quickly through the Soviet republics on the Baltic Sea, as well as Belorussia and Ukraine, before entering the territory of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Hoping to win the war within a few months, the German forces were stopped near Moscow at the end of 1941. Unable to resume the offensive on the entire eastern front in the spring of 1942, they opted for a push towards the south-east, occupying all of Ukraine in the process and reaching the Northern Caucasus by August 1942. At this point, Germany had captured a vast geographical space between besieged Leningrad and the Northern Caucasus. All the German-occupied territory of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, including the Crimean Peninsula, came under German military administration. Most of it was liberated again by the Red Army in 1943. Soviet troops returned to the North Caucasus in January-February 1943 and to central-western Russia mainly in the summer and autumn of 1943. The western regions of the Soviet Union remained under German rule until 1944.\r\n\r\nIn 1939, some 109,000,000 people lived in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. On the eve of the invasion, there were some 207,000 Jews in the territories that were to come under German occupation, about one percent of the total population in that area. During the first months of the war, most Jews either managed to escape on their own, or they were evacuated by the Soviet government, generally to the Northern Caucasus and to southern Russia. Jewish evacuees were relocated to southern Russia until mid-December 1941. This area came under German occupation in 1942. Due to the speed of the German advance, however, and poor means of transportation, a considerable number of Jews could not get away in time and found themselves under German occupation. The German murder campaign against the Jews on Russian territory was carried out by the Einsatzgruppen. It started as early as summer 1941 in the northwest and in many places in the central-western region of Russia and lasted until the beginning of 1943. In the south-western territories of Russia, including the Northern Caucasus, which were occupied only between July and November 1942, the murder of the Jews began later and the period of extermination was very short. According to estimates, the extermination of the Jews in Russia between 1941 and 1943 left between 60,000 and 100,000 dead.\r\n\r\nAccording to a census in 1939, there were 88,242 “Tsygane” living in the territory of the Soviet Union, the vast majority (61,262) of whom lived in the territory of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR; at the time including Crimea). In the context of the nationality policy of the 1920s and 1930s, Roma activists had founded their own organization, cultural institutions like the theatre Romėn and some kolkhozes. In the German-occupied areas of Russia, Roma were executed in mass shootings, which began in the spring of 1942 (Crimea was a special case: there, Roma were murdered as early as the autumn of 1941). Many Roma fought in the Red Army or joined the partisan movement. It is estimated that up to 20,000 Roma were murdered in the territory of the RSFSR."

              "history": "In 1939, the Kingdom of Sweden, a parliamentary democracy, declared it would stay neutral in case of a war between the European powers. Germany’s conquest of Denmark and Norway in 1940, however, pulled Sweden into the Third Reich’s military sphere of influence. In this position, Sweden was no longer able to pursue its policy of “active neutrality”.\r\n\r\nBefore 1939, Sweden had a total population of about 6,326,000 people. Approximately 7,000 of them were Jews. At least 900 more arrived as refugees from occupied Norway, when the Norwegian collaborationist government prepared for the deportation of the country’s Jews in 1942. Since the 1920´s the Swedish refugee policy had been very strict, but faced with growing evidence of deportations and mass murder of the European Jews, and especially the deportation of the Norwegian Jews in 1942, the Swedish Foreign Ministry shifted its stance on immigration. As a result, all Jews who fled to Sweden were granted asylum. In October 1943, after the Germans prepared to arrest the Danish Jews. More than 7,000 of them managed to escape to Sweden by way of an organised flight action by the Danish resistance movement, individuals and Swedish-Jewish organisations. The Swedish authorities had also, prior to the flight action, declared that the Danish Jews would be welcomed. In 1944, Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat, issued thousands of protective papers in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, thereby protecting more than 4,500 Jews. In early 1945, Sweden was able to secure the release of some Scandinavian and other concentration camp inmates. Through the international UN-organization UNRRA and the Swedish Red Cross approximately 20,000 survivors were brought to Sweden in different phases. At the end of the war, the Red Cross organized transports of 15,500 concentration camp prisoners to Sweden, with the White Buses Operation. Most of the survivors came from Norway and Denmark; approximately 4,000 of them were Jews. After the German capitulation in May 1945, an additional 9,000, mostly Poles and Hungarians, from different concentration camps were transported by the so-called White Boats to Sweden.\r\n\r\nIn 1930, a census counted 471 Roma, who were families of the Kalderaša and had immigrated to Sweden in the second half of the 19th century. At the same time, several thousand “Resande” (\"travellers\") lived in Sweden, whose origin went back to Roma who had immigrated in the 16th century. Roma were subject to discrimination; for example, the Riksdag had issued an entry ban on foreign Roma in 1914, which remained in force until 1954. Discussions about Roma as an alleged “racial problem” intensified during the Second World War and led to a census of 453 Roma carried out as part of a police raid on May 31, 1943; 7,668 Resande were separately recorded by 1944. Further measures were not taken because the State Institute for Racial Biology opposed them. In 1945, a small number of Roma and Sinti survivors were admitted to the country as part of the “White Buses” and “White Ships” rescue operations."

              "history": "Until the end of the First World War, Slovakia belonged to the Hungarian half of the Habsburg Monarchy. After 1918, it became a part of the Czechoslovak Republic. Following the Munich agreement of September 1938, Slovakia declared autonomy. A single-party regime came to power, with Jozef Tiso as prime minister. In November 1938, the country lost much of its southern territories to Hungary. At Germany’s instigation, the Slovak Parliament proclaimed independence on 14 March 1939, but remained bound to Germany by a “Protection Agreement”. In the fall of 1939 Jozef Tiso became president of Slovakia. Internally, Slovakia retained a considerable degree of autonomy, especially in its anti-Jewish policy. Slovakia served Germany as a concentration area before the Wehrmacht’s assault on Poland and joined Hitler’s war on the Soviet Union in 1941 as well. The rise and activities of underground groups in Slovakia in 1944 led to the country’s occupation by the German army and immediate break out of an anti-German (and anti-Regime) Slovak National Uprising on 29 August 1944. The uprising was suppressed in late October 1944. Occupied Slovakia was gradually liberated from Germans by the Red Army which entered and advanced on Slovakia from the east. With the Germans leaving the Slovak capital Bratislava in April 1945, the Slovak administration ceased to exist and Slovakia became a part of Czechoslovakia once more. In 1993, the separation of the Czech and Slovak Republics made Slovakia an independent state.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census, Slovakia had a total population of 3,324,111 people in 1930. 136,000 of them were Jews whose assimilation by Slovak society was tenuous. Many had declared Jewish nationality. There was also a strong Zionist movement while others gravitated towards Hungarian culture. Slovak Jews who lived in the southern part of the country, which was taken over by Hungary in 1938, later shared the history of Hungarian Jewry (by not having received Hungarian citizenship, they were actually the first ones to be deported or included in the Labour Battalions). There were 89,000 Jews left in independent Slovakia. The Slovak government engaged in the confiscation of Jewish property and adopted various anti-Jewish laws from the spring of 1939 to September 1941. These laws were thereupon aggregated and reinforced from September 1941 into a so-called Jewish Code emulating the German Nuremberg Laws in legalising the discrimination against Jews. The confiscation of Jewish property and discrimination of Jews led to the total pauperization of the Jewish population. In order to get rid of tens of thousands socially dependent Jews, the Slovak government first started to set up labour camps for Jews and then negotiated deportations of Jews from Slovakia into territory controlled by Nazi Germany. On 25 March 1942, the Slovak government started to deport the Slovak Jews to ghettos and death camps in occupied Poland. From March to late October 1942, about 58,000 Jews were deported there and the majority of them were murdered. About 20,000 Jews were excluded from deportation (among them the inmates of labour camps), and about 5,000 fled from Slovakia or went into hiding. In 1944 about 2,000 Jews took part in the Slovak National Uprising (some of them in Jewish units). After the collapse of the uprising, an additional 13,000 Jews were deported to German concentration camps. Overall, about 25,000 Slovak Jews survived the war whereas approximately 105,000 Slovakian Jews, including those in areas annexed by Hungary, perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nThe total number of Roma living on the territory of Slovakia before the Second World War is difficult to state accurately. According to contemporary data, more than 26,000 people claimed to be Roma on Slovak territory after the territorial losses in 1938. However, a certain proportion of Roma declared themselves to be members of the majority population or other minorities. In 1927, the Czechoslovak Republic enacted a law requiring all “itinerant” Roma to register with authorities allowing the government to enact punitive and discriminatory laws aimed at Roma. In 1939, a law was passed that stripped some of the Roma population of their citizenship. During the Second World War, Roma in Slovak territories faced forced labour and forced resettlement.  A concentration camp primarily for Roma was established in Dubnica nad Váhom. After the German occupation in 1944, more Roma were killed by German forces and members of the paramilitary organization of the  Hlinka's Slovak People's Party, and Roma communities were liquidated. In January 1945, an epidemic of typhus broke out in Dubnica, due to poor sanitary conditions and overpopulation. A quarantine was declared and it was forbidden to send any more Roma to the camp. Under the pretext of transporting them to the hospital, the sick Roma were loaded onto a truck and taken to the local arms factory where 26 of them were murdered. The murders of Roma also took place in other places such as Kremnička and Nemecká. "

At the same time as EHRI had started its identification and investigation work, the National Archives of Belgium commenced a project which aimed to produce a guide to sources on Jewish life in Belgium. EHRI closely cooperated with this project’s directors and researchers. The identification of repositories holding Holocaust-related collections dramatically improved thanks to this collaborative identification work. \r\n\r\nOne of the most important Belgian archives for Holocaust research is Kazerne Dossin: Memorial, Museum and Research Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights. This museum and research centre actively collects material, often private collections, about the Holocaust in Belgium. It holds the largest collection of materials on the topic in Belgium, including original, photocopied and scanned materials. EHRI supported Kazerne Dossin by helping them transfer the existing texts into archival descriptions according to international archival standards and integrating new descriptions into this system. This resulted in a major step forward for Kazerne Dossin: from 17 collection descriptions, Kazerne Dossin now provides EHRI with hundreds of descriptions. It is continuing this effort in order to make all its materials publicly available on a collection level.\r\n\r\nMade up of the National Archives, 17 State Archives in the Provinces, the Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (CEGESOMA); and the Directorate-General for War Victims, the State Archives are another significant institution that hold Holocaust-related material. In particular, the National Archives branch in Brussels conserve the archive of the former Military Justice system, which includes all the post-war trial records. Some important city (and communal) archives also have Holocaust-related material, such as those of Brussels, Antwerp, Liège, Charleroi and Ghent. Moreover, EHRI has worked closely CEGESOMA. Collection descriptions from the Centre were selected via key-word selection and literature search (verification of bibliographies of key works on the Holocaust in Belgium) and integrated onto the Portal by EHRI. This export includes archival documents, manuscripts, interview descriptions, and photo descriptions. As for the Directorate-General for War Victims, it possesses one of the largest and most important collections on the Holocaust in Belgium from the victims’ perspective.\r\n\r\nThere are also several important private archival institutions in Belgium. Notably, the Jewish Museum of Belgium in Brussels, which holds important sources related to the victims, as do some remembrance organisations, such as the Auschwitz Foundation and the Foundation of Contemporary Memory, which collect testimonies.\r\n\r\nMany other sources are stored in repositories outside of Belgium. First of all, there are the archives of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (with branches in New York and Jerusalem) and the World Jewish Congress records on Belgium (stored at the Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati). The Yad Vashem archives hold both original and copied materials on Jews in Belgium, including the original documents of the Belgian Jewish Committee in London during the Second World War. Likewise, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum holds vast materials on Jews in Belgium, both originals and copies. Their copy collection on Belgium includes copies from Kazerne Dossin, the Directorate-General for War Victims, CEGESOMA, and the National Archives (Foreigners’ Police archives, Brüsseler Treuhandgesellschaft collection, Archive of the Diamond collection and other files). The USHMM’s original collections include the “Fela and Chaïm Perelman papers”. The extensive report on Belgium also includes references to publications on sources on Belgium stored in German and French archives (most notably, the German sources on Belgium kept at the French National Archives at Pierrefitte-sur-Seine, the sub-series AJ40, and those kept at the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv Freiburg)."

The archive and documentation centre of the Mémorial, the former Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine [CDJC, Centre of Contemporary Jewish Documentation[, holds more than 30 million archival documents, including many originals bearing the signatures of the heads of the Third Reich and those responsible for the deportation of the Jews from France.

When the Israeli Parliament entrusted Yad Vashem with the mission to commemorate the Shoah and its victims in 1953, Yad Vashem began to systematically collect Holocaust-related documentation from all kinds of sources.\r\n\r\nThe first documents arrived at Yad Vashem from the “Historical Commissions” and various documentation centres established after the war, mostly by Holocaust survivors, but also from public institutions, researchers and private individuals. Material collected in Israel was added to the documentation collected by Jews during the war in the ghettos, camps and hideaways, as well as materials collected in the first years after the war, for example in DP camps. Since its establishment, the Yad Vashem Archives have initiated activities with a view to collecting and copying Holocaust-related documents that have been housed in various archives in Europe and throughout the world.

Furthermore, EHRI identified a number of Holocaust-relevant research tools, including important online resources, but also traditional archival guides. For a full list, see the extensive report.\r\n\r\nNIOD was founded immediately after the war under the name of National Institute for War Documentation [Rijksinstituut voor Oorlogsdocumentatie, RIOD], under the auspices of the Ministry of Education, Culture & Science. In 1999 it was placed under the authority of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW). It holds important Holocaust collections, such as the archives of the German occupational administration, of the Joodse Raad and of several camps (especially Westerbork). Apart from official documentation, NIOD’s collection also includes private sources, such as journals, correspondence and pictures. A joint effort of the National Archive and NIOD led to the creation of a website on Dutch WWII archival sources, [Wegwijzer Archieven WOII](http://www.archievenwo2.nl/). A thematic query on “persecution of the Jews” [“Jodenvervolging”] leads to 773 archival collections in 142 archival institutions. These cover a broad variety of institutions, national as well as local and specialised institutions. There are also private archives and documentation centres, such as the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam, which hold important Holocaust-related collections."

They contain important source material produced by central government bodies, military and civilian authorities. Furthermore, Yad Vashem possesses important Holocaust-relevant material on Romania, such as the Wilhelm Filderman Archive: Chairman of the Federation of Jewish Communities in Romania, 1924-1947, and the Romanian Collection, which contains documentation on the history of Romanian Jews during the Holocaust period. Due to Romania’s expansion into Soviet territory during the Second World War, vast collections of Holocaust-relevant sources regarding Romania could also be identified in Ukraine, especially at the State Archives of the Odessa and Mykolaiv Oblasts, and in Moldova."

Preliminary contact with key Holocaust research and archival institutions in Russia has been established in order to facilitate future exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in the country. In order to identify the Russian archival institutions which store Holocaust-relevant resources, EHRI relied on expert knowledge readily available in EHRI’s partner institutions, such as Yad Vashem and the Warsaw-based Jewish Historical Institute [Żydowski Instytut Historyczny, ŻIH]. As a result, EHRI has identified over 50 archives which either certainly hold Holocaust-relevant material or can be expected to do so. While the full list can also be found in the extensive report, at least five central institutions should be named here:\r\n- the State Archives of the Russian Federation (GARF) in Moscow, which include the files of the Extraordinary State Committee to Investigate German Fascist Crimes Committed on Soviet Territory, the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee files as well as the Nuremberg Collection;\r\n- the Russian State Archives of Socio-Political History (RGASPI) in Moscow, which hold the files of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the General Headquarters of the Partisans in the Soviet Union with reports on the occupied areas. Based on the results of a joint survey of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Yad Vashem, EHRI has integrated several collection descriptions from RGASPI;\r\n- the Central Archives of the Russian Defence Ministry (TsAMO) in Podolsk, which hold reports from Red Army records (Main Political Administration of the Red Army, GLAVPUR) resembling those of the Partisan’s General HQ in RGASPI and store “trophy” (captured) documents mostly of German provenance;\r\n- the Russian State Military Archives [Rossiiskii gosudarstvennyi voennyi arkhiv, RGVA], which house a large number of similarly captured collections not only of German provenance, but also many related to the Jewish communities in France, Belgium, Greece, Austria etc.; and\r\n- an extensive collection of interviews with local citizens and Red Army servicemen conducted right after the liberation of territories of the Soviet Union is held by the Scientific Archive of the Russian History Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences\r\n\r\nRegional archives hold local files generated by the abovementioned Extraordinary Commission, as well as material from local occupation administrations such as administrative files, lists of persecuted or displaced citizens, propaganda newspapers etc. Most documents related to Holocaust can be found in two types of collections: in the fonds of the local Extraordinary Commission and in the fonds of the Partisan movement. The Extraordinary Commission Fonds is usually held by the central State archive, while the documents about partisan movement can be found in the former party archive. In the regional centers usually there are two archives: State archives and the former party archives."
