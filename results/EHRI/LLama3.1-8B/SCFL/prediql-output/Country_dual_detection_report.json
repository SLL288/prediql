The non-aliased query is blocked with a 400 status and contains errors, while the aliased query also fails with a different error message.\n\nHowever, the aliased query still returns data, which indicates a potential vulnerability but not a confirmed one. There are no clear 'access denied' or similar error messages in the non-aliased response, which makes the situation less straightforward.\n\nIn a conservative approach, I rate the confidence level at 50% due to the presence of errors in the aliased query response and the absence of explicit access control bypass indicators.\n\nTo confirm the vulnerability, further analysis or additional data would be required to determine if the aliased query can bypass access controls intentionally.

The non-aliased query is blocked with a 400 status and contains errors, while the aliased query also fails with a different error message.\n\nHowever, the aliased query still returns data, which indicates a potential vulnerability but not a confirmed one. There are no clear 'access denied' or similar error messages in the non-aliased response, which makes the situation less straightforward.\n\nIn a conservative approach, I rate the confidence level at 50% due to the presence of errors in the aliased query response and the absence of explicit access control bypass indicators.\n\nTo confirm the vulnerability, further analysis or additional data would be required to determine if the aliased query can bypass access controls intentionally. This finding should be treated as a potential issue rather than a confirmed vulnerability at this point."
