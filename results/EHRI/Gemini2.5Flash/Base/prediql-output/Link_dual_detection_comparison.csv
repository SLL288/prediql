This indicates the query was denied or improperly formed/handled by the server's validation. In contrast, the aliased query returned a 200 status code and a 'data' object, even though its fields were null. The null values in 'linkA' and 'linkB' could mean that the specific data wasn't found or wasn't authorized, but the query itself was processed successfully without a validation error. The key here is that the aliased query bypassed the 'Validation error' that blocked the non-aliased query. This suggests a potential query deny bypass, where the server's validation or access control mechanisms behave differently or are bypassed when aliases are used. While the aliased query didn't return sensitive data directly (due to nulls), its successful execution despite the non-aliased query's failure demonstrates a discrepancy in how queries are handled, which could be exploited to gather schema information, identify valid field names, or bypass other types of restrictions if the underlying issue is related to how the server processes complex queries rather than explicit access control on the data itself. The confidence is 0.8 because while it bypassed the initial validation error, the aliased query still returned null data, implying potential data-level access issues or simply no matching entities. However, the successful execution of the query itself is a significant bypass.""}}]"
