                "history": "During the Second World War, Argentina officially remained neutral for most of the conflict. A significant portion of Argentina’s population was of German origin and Nazi propaganda was highly influential, especially in the predominantly German communities in the northeast of the country. In March 1945, Argentina declared war on Japan and its ally Germany, just before their capitulation.\r\n\r\nBetween 1918 and 1933, 79,000 Jews migrated to Argentina thanks to its relaxed immigration policies. However, rising numbers of Jewish refugees contributed to the tightening of immigration laws in 1938. Shortly before the start of the Second World War, the Argentinian government sent a secret circular to its consuls in Europe ordering them to deny visas to Jewish applicants. The impact was significant; between 1933 and 1943, only 24,000 Jewish refugees were officially admitted into the country, while 20,000 Jews entered Argentina illegally. According to the census of 1947, there was a Jewish population of 249,330 out of a total population of 15,893,827. \r\n\r\nArgentina had and has a small Roma population. For this country there are no sufficient findings on the history of Roma during the Second World War. EHRI would be pleased to receive any information. ",
                "summary": "EHRI has identified several Holocaust related archival institutions: Museo y Archivo Histórico Regional de las Colonias Judías, Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA), Archivo de la Fundación IWO-Instituto Judio de Investigaciones, Museo del Holocausto. Relevant Holocaust material is held by Carmen Rosenblatt de Kogan (private collection) and by AMIA - Centro Marc Turkow. However, EHRI is yet to determine the exact nature and significance of Holocaust-related holdings in these institutions, as well as those of the Archivo General de la Nación [General Archive of the Nation] and the Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores [Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Worship].",

                "history": "Austria was occupied and annexed by the German Reich in March 1938. Many Austrians welcomed this “Anschluss”, after which they were treated as Germans. On April 10, 1938, the “Act on the Reunification of Austria with the German Reich” was recognized by a referendum. Austria was integrated into the general administration of the German Reich and subdivided into seven Reichsgaue in 1939. In 1945, the Red Army took Vienna and eastern parts of the country, while the Western Allies occupied the western and southern sections.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Austria had a total population of about 6,753,000 people. After the “Anschluss” [annexation], 206,000 of them, including refugees from Germany, were persecuted as Jews under the Nuremberg Laws. The Austrian Nazi Party, which had been outlawed before the “Anschluss”, however, did not target only the Jews, but also other ethnic, social and political groups, such as the Roma, their political opponents, the disabled, “anti-social elements”, and others. In the process, Austrians became involved in all types of Nazi crimes. In the first days and weeks of Nazi rule, Jews were subjected to brutal outbreaks of violence, including theft and murder. Subsequently, most Jews in the provinces were forced to move to Vienna or abroad. The “Zentralstelle für jüdische Auswanderung in Wien” (“Central Office for Jewish Emigration in Vienna”), founded by the SS in August 1938, not only served as a model for the organisation of the expulsions, but also for the mass deportations from October 1939 onwards. Similar institutions were founded in Berlin, Prague, and Amsterdam. After the November pogroms in 1938, about 6,500 mostly male Jews from Austria were imprisoned, and 4,000 among them were sent to the Dachau concentration camp. By the beginning of the war in September 1939 about 130,000 Jews fled from Austria. During the war, the remaining Jews in Austria were subjected to ever increasing isolation by new regulations, including forced transferal to smaller quarters and the introduction of the obligatory Jewish Star in 1941. Austrian Jews were deported to ghettos, concentration and extermination camps, among others to Nisko, Kielce, Opole, Theresienstadt/Terezín, Litzmannstadt/Łódź, Riga, Maly Trostinez/Maly Trascianiec and Auschwitz-Birkenau. In May / June 1944, Jewish prisoners, mostly from Hungary, were moved to camps in Austria, particularly to the Mauthausen concentration camp complex and forced labour camps along the Eastern border. Especially in March and April 1945 thousands of them died on death marches. Overall, around 66,000 Austrian Jews perished in the Holocaust. \r\n\r\nThere were about 11,000 Roma living in Austria before the war. They were subject to harsh racist campaigns throughout the first decades of the 1900s. Shortly after the “Anschluss” in March 1938, Roma and Sinti were deprived of their rights as citizens and several hundred were deported to concentration camps. Since 1939, many detention camps (so-called “Zigeunerlager” [“Gypsy Camps”]) were erected in several places all over Austria. The largest camp was Lackenbach, which held around 4,000 Roma from the Burgenland. In November 1941, 5007 Austrian Roma were deported to the ghetto in Litzmannstadt. No one survived: They died in the ghetto or were murdered in Kulmhof. Since March 1943, Sinti and Roma were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Of the estimated 11,000 pre-war Roma, Sinti and Lovara population who were Austrian citizens in 1938, only 1,500 to 2,000 survived. ",
                "summary": "Key institutions identified by EHRI include the Austrian State Archives [Österreichisches Staatsarchiv/ Archiv der Republik] and the respective state archives of the Austrian Bundesländer [Federal States], which hold surviving files of central and regional administrative bodies as well as post-war investigations; the state-operated Archive of the Mauthausen Memorial, which contains files of the Mauthausen concentration camp complex; the Dokumentationsarchiv des Österreichischen Widerstandes, which contains material from private hands as well as serving as a hub for highly pertinent copied files accrued from dozens of archives as well as the Forschungsstelle Nachkriegsjustiz, which has collected the scattered information on post-war trials for Nazi war crimes; the Archiv der IKG Wien, which contains the files of the Vienna Jewish community, which encompassed the vast majority of Austrian Jews; the Vienna Wiesenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies, with the holdings of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime and private collections of Holocaust researchers. EHRI has identified a number of general and Holocaust-relevant archival guides and online resources, a full list of which is available in the EHRI extensive report on Austria.",
                "extensive": "Disclaimer: The EHRI Extensive Report was updated in 2024.\r\n\r\n**A. EHRI approach to Austria: Pre-existing research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Austria, EHRI could rely on a number of pre-existing works on the Holocaust. Highly useful for EHRI’s identification efforts was a general overview of archives in Austria, Germany and Switzerland:\r\n\r\n[2009] *Archive in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz. Ein Adressenverzeichnis* (Münster: Ardey, 2009). Book + CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n[2023] *Archive in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz. Adressenverzeichnis 2023/2024* (Münster: Ardey, 2023). Book + CD-ROM\r\n\r\nThe publications of the Austrian Historians’ Commission [Österreichische Historikerkommission], which are available and searchable online at http://www.boehlau.at/histkom, are also helpful. Furthermore, the following platform is an important and specifically Holocaust-relevant online resource:\r\n\r\nNS-Quellen\r\nThis resource is dedicated to issues of expropriation between 1938 and 1945, and to issues of restitution and compensation after 1945. The platform itself is an entry point. Researchers will find detailed information about resources that can provide them with valuable assistance in their research (for example: In which Austrian archives can I find documents on expropriation? Where can I conduct research on citizenship revocation?; or how? How can I find out whether a specific property or rental was “aryanised”?). The platform offers an overview of the legal foundations of both the Nazi expropriation of property as well as restitution and compensation from the Republic of Austria after 1945. It gives direct access to the original texts of all the laws relevant to this context. There are also bibliographic references and explanations of individual terms. The information is in German. See here: (http://ns-quellen.at)\r\n\r\nInformation about further digital resources and services in Austria can be found on the website of EHRI Austria: https://www.ehri.at/en/projects/ \r\n\r\nAmong the more traditional research tools, the following guide is worth mentioning:\r\n[1995, 1991] Boberach, Heinz (Ed.), *Inventar archivalischer Quellen des NS-Staates. Die Überlieferung von Behörden und Einrichtungen des Reichs, der Länder und der NSDAP*, 2 Teile, (Munich: Saur, 1991, 1995). Also included in the commercial database “Deutsche Geschichte im 20. Jahrhundert Online: Nationalsozialismus, Holocaust, Widerstand und Exil 1933-1945”, http://db.saur.de/DGO.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Austrian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAustria exhibits a highly differentiated archival system without much centralisation. In addition to the Federal Archives and its departments (governed by the Bundesarchivgesetz), each of the Austrian Bundesländer has its own State Archive (each governed by the respective state Archivgesetz or statute). There are over 50 city archives. The religious communities in Austria, first and foremost bodies and organisations of the Catholic Church, exhibit a rich array of archival institutions. University archives, archives of noble houses (in particular the Liechtenstein archives) and a number of other, mostly topical archives as well as libraries holding archival material also exist.\r\n\r\nKey institutions identified by EHRI include the Austrian State Archive (Österreichisches Staatsarchiv/ Archiv der Republik), which has an online search engine (http://www.archivinformationssystem.at/suchinfo.aspx), and the respective state archives of the Austrian Bundesländer, which hold surviving files of central and regional administrative bodies as well as post-war investigations. Likewise important are the state operated Archive of the Mauthausen Memorial, which contains files of the Mauthausen concentration camp complex; the Dokumentationsarchiv des Österreichischen Widerstandes (DÖW), which contains material from private hands as well as serving as a hub for highly pertinent copied files accrued from dozens of archives; the Archive of the Jewish Community Vienna (Archiv der IKG Wien), which contains the files of the Vienna Jewish community encompassing the vast majority of Austrian Jews; the Vienna Wiesenthal Institute; for Holocaust Studies (VWI); and the Forschungsstelle Nachkriegsjustiz, which has collected the scattered information on post-war trials for Nazi war crimes.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Austria**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Austria**\r\n\r\nIn Austria, EHRI has identified over 200 state, municipal and church archives. While well over 25% of these archives are clustered in or around Vienna, there are also important archives in all Austrian Bundesländer.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Austria, material relevant to the Holocaust in Austria can be found in a number of institutions, including the German Bundesarchiv and the Arolsen Archives in Germany, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University, Yad Vashem, the Central Archive of the Jewish People in Jerusalem, the Wiener Holocaust Library in London, the Leo Baeck Institute in Jerusalem, New York/Berlin, and London, the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam as well as the National Archives of Hungary and the Hungarian Jewish Archives in Budapest, the Historical Jewish Institute in Warsaw, and the Jewish Museum in Prague.

Australian troops fought Germany and Italy in Europe, the Mediterranean and North Africa and they fought Japan in South-East Asia and the Pacific.\r\n\r\nBy 1901, there were an estimated 15,000 Jews in Australia. When the Nazis took power in Germany in 1933, many German Jews migrated to Australia. The Australian government was initially hesitant in permitting entry to many Jews, but in 1938, it allotted 15,000 visas to “victims of oppression”. Some 7,000 Jews were able to obtain these visas before the outbreak of the Second World War put an end to the program. Jews from Germany were interned as enemy aliens from the start of the war until 1942. In the aftermath of the Second World War, Australia gradually abandoned its previous Anglo-centric immigration policy and permitted immigration of some European Jews who were survivors of the Holocaust. In 1939, Australia had a population of 6,935,000.\r\n\r\nFor this country there are no sufficient findings on the history of Roma during the Second World War. EHRI would be pleased to receive any information. ",

                "history": "Annexed by Austria-Hungary in 1908, Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of Yugoslavia between the world wars. In April 1941, when Germany’s twelve-day campaign against Yugoslavia led to its partition between the Axis powers and their allies, Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of the Independent State of Croatia [Nezavisna Država Hrvatska, NDH], founded on 10 April 1941. While the Ustaše movement and its leader (Poglavnik), Ante Pavelić, assumed authority, the new state depended on German and Italian support. The Independent State of Croatia effectively ceased to exist in May 1945. Bosnia and Herzegovina became one of the six republics within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It declared independence in 1992.\r\n\r\nBefore the Second World War, Bosnia and Herzegovina had a total population of 2.5 million inhabitants. Of this population, about 14,500 were Jews spread throughout some 20 Jewish communities. Between 1933 and 1940, this number greatly increased as some 55,000 Jews from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia fled through the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Only 4,000 of these Jews remained in April 1941. The Ustaše movement implemented a policy of discrimination, expropriation and mass murder against Serbs, Roma, communists, and Jews. The Independent State of Croatia established a number of camps. In 1941, deportation of Jews began to concentration camps in Gospić, Jadovno, Jasenovac, Stara Gradiška, Đakovo, Loborgrad and others, and in 1942, to Auschwitz. Concentration camps claimed the lives of almost 80 % of Jews from Bosnia and Herzegovina. About 10,000 members of the pre-war Bosnian Jewish population had been murdered by 1945.\r\n\r\nAt least around 4,000 Roma lived on the eve of the Second World War in the territories of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina. The pro-fascist Ustasha movement led a genocidal policy towards the Roma in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Part of the Muslim intellectual and religious community claimed that 'White Gypsies' (Muslim sedentary Roma) must be considered as an integral part of the Muslim community ('Aryans') and therefore be spared from persecution. Such views and demands were published in May 1942 in the 'Zenica Resolution' which was accepted by the Ustasha authorities. A significant part of the rest of the Roma community was persecuted mostly through deportation to camps (especially the Jasenovac camp), where they were tortured and killed. Some Roma joined the anti-fascist partisan resistance movement. Despite some Muslim Roma being rescued during the war, the Roma community was still devastated. In the census of 1948, there were only 442 Roma identified.",
                "summary": "In Bosnia and Herzegovina, EHRI has identified a helpful guide which contains general information about Bosnian archives:\r\n\r\n- Bakaršić, Kemal, *Fragmenti kulturne historije Bosne i Hercegovine* (Sarajevo: Magistrat, 2005)\r\n\r\nSeveral archival institutions in the country have guides offering details about their collections but they are rarely available in English. More importantly, EHRI has identified several repositories relevant for Holocaust research, and described over 60 collections in this country. The Archives of Bosnia-Herzegovina can be considered the most important institution to hold Holocaust-relevant material in the country, as they have a vast collection from the Second World War period and from the Research Commission of Crimes Committed by Occupying Forces. Furthermore, the Jewish Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina [Muzej Jevreja Bosne i Hercegovine], which is a branch of the Museum of Sarajevo [Muzej Sarajevo], and the Historical Archives Sarajevo [Historijski arhiv Sarajevo] have documents concerning the Holocaust. Other archives and institutions in the country which are likely to be relevant for Holocaust research are the Jewish Community of Sarajevo, the Tuzla County Archives [Arhiv Tuzlanskog kantona] and Archives of Republika Srpska, among others.\r\n\r\nOutside of Bosnia and Herzegovina, certain Croatian archives, such as the Croatian State Archive in Zagreb and Osijek, may have further relevant material. In Serbia, the Jewish Historical Museum [Jevrejski istorijski muzej] in Belgrade holds significant amount of material pertaining to the Holocaust period in Bosnia. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) offers a number of relevant oral history interviews, and repositories in Germany and Italy are very likely to have collections pertaining to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\n",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Bosnia-Herzegovina: Pre-existing research, available archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nResearch conducted on the subject of the Holocaust in Bosnia and Herzegovina is still under development. In the last decade there has been some increase in research and interest in Holocaust-relevant sources, but mainly from outside the country (studies produced were either funded by the European Union or conducted by researchers from abroad). Sources that were particularly relevant to EHRI’s survey work include the following monographs: Anisa Hasanhnodžić, Rifet Rustemović, *After the traces of our neighbours: Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Holocaust* (Sarajevo: Institut za istoriju, 2015); Rusmir Agačević, *Snovopriče o Sefardima i Aškenazima travničkim* (Zagreb, 2013); Jakov Danon, Verica M. Stošić, *Memoari na holokaust Jevreja Bosanske krajine* (Banja Luka, Arhiv Republike Srpske, 2009); Aleksandar Gaon (ed.), *Mi smo preživeli…: Jevreji o holokaustu* (Beograd, 2001-2007); Avram Pinto, *Jevreji Sarajeva i Bosne i Hercegovine* (Sarajevo:Veselin Masleša, 1987); Jaša Romano, *Jevreji Jugoslavije 1941-1945. Žrtve genocida i učesnici Narodnooslobodilačkog rata* (Belgrade, Jevrejski istorijski muzej, 1980); Eli Tauber, *Kako se sporovodio holokaust u Bosni i Hercegovini* (Sarajevo, 2012), Eli Tauber, *When neighbours were real human beings* (Sarajevo, Jevrejska zajednica, 2010). EHRI also relied on dozens of written articles published in several journals (*Most, Baština sjeveroistočne Bosne, Jevrejski pregled, Jevrejski glas, Sefarad 92*, etc.), memoirs and previously conducted surveys and copies of relevant documentation performed by third parties, mainly by the USHMM, are also useful. EHRI has also identified a helpful guide which contains general information about Bosnian archives:\r\n\r\n- Bakaršić, Kemal, *Fragmenti kulturne historije Bosne i Hercegovine* (Sarajevo: Magistrat, 2005).\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s archival system**\r\n\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina has a heavily decentralized political structure that is reflected in its archival system as well. The central archival institution, the Archives of Bosnia-Herzegovina, is located in Sarajevo, the capital city. The majority of relevant records for Holocaust research are stored there, but the institution has no control over other archives in the country. There are two provincial (entity’s) archives, the “Archive of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina”, which does not hold Holocaust-related material, and “Archive of Republika Srpska,” which operate in their respective political entities, which were formed by the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995. Besides them, there is an archive in the District of Brčko. As with the Archive of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Brčko archives does not hold Holocaust-related material. The Archive of Republika Srpska has several branches, but it operates as a centralized institution, with headquarters in Banja Luka. Moreover, the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, besides having its archival institution, also has cantonal (county) archives. These archives operate in most of the cantons (Travnik, Široki Brijeg, Bihać, Mostar, Tuzla, Goražde, Sarajevo). However, these institutions are independent and work under their own, cantonal laws. This heavily decentralized archival system can sometimes be a hindrance to efficient research. It is also worth noting that most of the archives are still in development, which can further delay research and availability of records.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Bosnia and Herzegovina**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Bosnia and Herzegovina**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified a number of archival institutions and other types of organisations which hold Holocaust-relevant documents and has described over 60 collections. The Archives of Bosnia-Herzegovina are the most important institution in possession of Holocaust-relevant material as they hold a vast collection from the Second World War period and from the Research Commission of Crimes Committed by Occupying Forces. Furthermore, the Jewish Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina [Muzej Jevreja Bosne i Hercegovine], which is a branch of the Museum of Sarajevo [Muzej Sarajevo], the Historical Archives Sarajevo [Historijski arhiv Sarajevo] and the archives of Jewish communities (Sarajevo, Doboj, Mostar and others) have documents that are relevant for Holocaust research. The collections and fonds of these institutions cover a broad range of documentation, but they mostly contain administrative, political and judicial documentation created by authorities (local or higher levels), organizations, military structures, etc.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Bosnia and Herzegovina, EHRI was able to identify a significant number of Holocaust-related collections at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, which holds selected records from several Bosnian archives (Travnik, Tuzla, Sarajevo), individuals and communities. Relevant material can also be found in other former Yugoslav countries, namely, Serbia and Croatia. The Jewish Museum in Belgrade (Serbia) and the Croatian State Archives (in Zagreb) contain numerous collections related to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Jews and the Holocaust.",

                "history": "Belgium was invaded by German forces on 10 May 1940 and surrendered on 28 May under the orders of King Leopold III. The King stayed in Belgium, but the Prime Minister and many cabinet members fled to London, where they set up a government-in-exile. The German occupiers formed a military administration (for Belgium and Northern France), led by Alexander von Falkenhausen, which was replaced by a civilian administration in July 1944. Belgium was liberated in September of that year, although the fighting and bombing continued in parts of the country until May 1945.\r\n\r\nDuring the occupation, German orders resulted in the registration of about 57,000 Jews in Belgium, out of a total Belgian population of over 8 million. Of those Jews, 10 percent at the most were Belgian citizens; the others were mostly recent immigrants from Eastern and Central Europe. Over 90 percent of the Jewish population resided in Brussels and Antwerp. Shortly after the German invasion, the Belgian government arrested a few thousand German (and Austrian) nationals, including Jews, and sent them to camps in France. The Jews among them were later included in the deportations from France. Anti-Jewish legislation was first enacted in October 1940, while the economic plundering of the Jews began in May 1941. In April 1941, a pogrom took place in Antwerp, organized by local anti-Jewish organizations. In May 1942, the Yellow Star became obligatory. Then, in July 1942, Jews were summoned to the Dossin barracks [\"Sammellager Mechelen/Malines\"], a new transit camp in Mechelen (a city between Antwerp and Brussels) through an “Arbeitseinsatzbefehl” [“work order”]. In the summer of 1942, the German police forces and their collaborators actively started looking for Jews, with large raids taking place in Brussels and Antwerp. The deportations began on 4 August 1942 and lasted until 31 July 1944. A total of 28 convoys left the Dossin camp, mainly for Auschwitz, four convoys left for other camps: one to Ravensbrück-Buchenwald and Bergen-Belsen, and two to Vittel. Overall, 25,490 Jews arrested in Belgium and northern France were deported from Mechelen. The vast majority perished in the camps, approximately 1,700 survived.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War, a few hundred Sinti and Roma lived in Belgium. The Belgian’s Aliens Police particularly targeted Roma and Sinti in its activities to take action against those who were considered a threat to national security or public morals. On 21 December 1941 the Belgian Aliens Police introduced the so-called “Carte de Nomade / Zigeunerkaart” [“Gypsy Card”], a new identification card exclusively for Sinti and Roma. These temporary residence permits had to be renewed every three months and later served to track people down in raids and for deportations, which started in 1943. 352 Sinti and Roma, arrested in Belgium and Northern France were deported from the Dossin barracks [\"Sammellager Mechelen/Malines\"] on 15 January 1944 to Auschwitz-Birkenau. 10 individuals were deported there separately. 34 of them survived.",
                "summary": "EHRI has identified a number of helpful publications and archival guides on Belgium (see the extensive report). At the same time as EHRI had started its identification and investigation work, the National Archives of Belgium commenced a project which aimed to produce a guide to sources on Jewish life in Belgium. EHRI closely cooperated with this project’s directors and researchers. The identification of repositories holding Holocaust-related collections dramatically improved thanks to this collaborative identification work. \r\n\r\nOne of the most important Belgian archives for Holocaust research is Kazerne Dossin: Memorial, Museum and Research Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights. This museum and research centre actively collects material, often private collections, about the Holocaust in Belgium. It holds the largest collection of materials on the topic in Belgium, including original, photocopied and scanned materials. EHRI supported Kazerne Dossin by helping them transfer the existing texts into archival descriptions according to international archival standards and integrating new descriptions into this system. This resulted in a major step forward for Kazerne Dossin: from 17 collection descriptions, Kazerne Dossin now provides EHRI with hundreds of descriptions. It is continuing this effort in order to make all its materials publicly available on a collection level.\r\n\r\nMade up of the National Archives, 17 State Archives in the Provinces, the Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (CEGESOMA); and the Directorate-General for War Victims, the State Archives are another significant institution that hold Holocaust-related material. In particular, the National Archives branch in Brussels conserve the archive of the former Military Justice system, which includes all the post-war trial records. Some important city (and communal) archives also have Holocaust-related material, such as those of Brussels, Antwerp, Liège, Charleroi and Ghent. Moreover, EHRI has worked closely CEGESOMA. Collection descriptions from the Centre were selected via key-word selection and literature search (verification of bibliographies of key works on the Holocaust in Belgium) and integrated onto the Portal by EHRI. This export includes archival documents, manuscripts, interview descriptions, and photo descriptions. As for the Directorate-General for War Victims, it possesses one of the largest and most important collections on the Holocaust in Belgium from the victims’ perspective.\r\n\r\nThere are also several important private archival institutions in Belgium. Notably, the Jewish Museum of Belgium in Brussels, which holds important sources related to the victims, as do some remembrance organisations, such as the Auschwitz Foundation and the Foundation of Contemporary Memory, which collect testimonies.\r\n\r\nMany other sources are stored in repositories outside of Belgium. First of all, there are the archives of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (with branches in New York and Jerusalem) and the World Jewish Congress records on Belgium (stored at the Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati). The Yad Vashem archives hold both original and copied materials on Jews in Belgium, including the original documents of the Belgian Jewish Committee in London during the Second World War. Likewise, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum holds vast materials on Jews in Belgium, both originals and copies. Their copy collection on Belgium includes copies from Kazerne Dossin, the Directorate-General for War Victims, CEGESOMA, and the National Archives (Foreigners’ Police archives, Brüsseler Treuhandgesellschaft collection, Archive of the Diamond collection and other files). The USHMM’s original collections include the “Fela and Chaïm Perelman papers”. The extensive report on Belgium also includes references to publications on sources on Belgium stored in German and French archives (most notably, the German sources on Belgium kept at the French National Archives at Pierrefitte-sur-Seine, the sub-series AJ40, and those kept at the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv Freiburg).",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Belgium: Pre-existing research and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nTwo official research projects, commissioned by the Belgian State, that have been carried out by CEGESOMA and others, have mapped a significant proportion of Holocaust-related archives in Belgium. The first project, conducted in 2001, was about the spoliation of Jewish assets during the war. The second, the results of which were published in 2007, investigated the possible responsibility of Belgian national and local authorities in the persecution of the Jews. The major publications resulting from these projects were:\r\n\r\n- *Les biens des victims des persécutions anti-juives en Belgique: spoliation, rétablissement des droits, résultats de la Commission d’étude. / De bezittingen van de slachtoffers van de jodenvervolging in België: spoliatie, rechtsherstel, bevindingen van de studiecommissie: eindverslag*, Brussels: Chancellery of the Prime Minister, July 2001\r\n\r\n- Rudi Van Doorslaer (dir), Emmanuel Debruyne, Frank Seberechts, Nico Wouters (a.l.p.d. Lieven Saerens), *La Belgique docile. Les autorités belges et la persécution des juifs en Belgique durant la Seconde guerre mondiale*, Brussel, Luc Pire/Ceges, 2007, 2 vol., 1,545 p. / Rudi Van Doorslaer (red.), Emmanuel Debruyne, Frank Seberechts, Nico Wouters (i.s.m. Lieven Saerens), *Gewillig België. Overheid en Jodenvervolging tijdens de Tweede Wereldoorlog*, Antwerpen/Brussel, Meulenhoff-Manteau/Soma, 2007, 1,163 p.\r\n\r\nAt the same time as EHRI had started its identification and investigation work, the National Archives of Belgium commenced a project which aimed to produce a guide to sources on Jewish life in Belgium. EHRI closely cooperated with the directors of the project at the National Archives and the two project researchers, Gertjan Desmet and Pascale Falek Alhadeff. The major publication resulting from this project was:\r\n\r\n- Pierre-Alain Tallier (dir.), Gertjan Desmet & Pascale Falek-Alhadeff, *Sources pour l'histoire des populations juives et du judaïsme en Belgique/Bronnen voor de geschiedenis van de Joden en het Jodendom in België, 19de-21ste eeuw*, Brussel, ARA-AGR/Avant-Propos, 2016, 1,328 p.\r\n\r\nBefore the publication of this guide, no such archival overview existed, although there were other synopses available that dealt with periodicals and publications on Jewish history (and in the case of the latter, indirectly shed light on certain primary sources, although its main focus was on secondary sources):\r\n\r\n- Zosa Szajkowski. “Bibliography of Jewish Periodicals in Belgium, 1841–1959”, *Studies in Bibliography and Booklore*, Vol. 4, No. 3 (June 1960), pp. 103-122 (Published by: Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion; Article Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/27943319).\r\n\r\n- Daniel Dratwa. *Répertoire des périodiques juifs parus en Belgique de 1841 à 1986*, Brussels: Pro Museo Judaico, 1987.\r\n\r\n- Barbara Dickschen — Jacques Déom — Catherine Massange — Jean-Philippe Schreiber, *Guide Bibliographique: Les Juifs en Belgique*, Brussels, Fondation de la Mémoire Contemporaine-Stichting Eigentijdse Herinnering, 2008 [updated version in 2014].\r\n\r\nIn addition to the works mentioned above, EHRI’s identification work relied on many other publications on the Holocaust in Belgium as well as other archival guides (none of which were entirely dedicated to Holocaust sources). For a general introduction to sources on Belgian contemporary history, see:\r\n\r\n- Patricia Van den Eeckhout & Guy Vanthemsche (eds.), *Bronnen voor de studie van het hedendaagse België, 19e-21e eeuw* (Brussels: Koninklijke Commissie voor Geschiedenis / Commission royale d'Histoire, 2017, 3rd revised edition).\r\n\r\nFor finding aids on sources on Belgium during the Second World War in German and French archives, see:\r\n\r\n- Stefan Martens & Sebastian Remus, *Frankreich und Belgien unter deutscher Besatzung 1940-1944; die Bestände des Bundesarchiv-Militärarchivs Freiburg* (Stuttgart: Jan Thorbecke Verlag, 2002).\r\n\r\n- Guy Beaujouan, Anne-Marie Bourgoin, Pierre Cézard, et.al., *La France et la Belgique sous l'occupation allemande, 1940-1944. Les fonds allemands conservés au Centre historique des Archives nationales. Inventaire de la sous-série AJ40* (Paris: Centre historique des Archives nationales, 2002).\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Belgian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nBelgium has a large number of repositories, considering the size of the country, and they are a mixture of public and private initiatives. This means researchers can sometimes find them hard to navigate. When looking for basic information about victims, local and national administrations are often in possession of personal files. The majority of Jews in Belgium were not Belgian nationals (less than 10 percent at the registration in 1940). For the non-naturalized legal residents the Belgian Foreigners’ Police kept personal or family files. These files are held in both local level institutions (the city administrations) and in the National Archives (central files). It is important to note that the Jewish communities in Belgium were concentrated in Brussels and Antwerp, and to a far lesser extent in Charleroi and Liège. Following the decree from 29 August 1942, Jews were only allowed to live in one of these four cities. But still there are interesting sources in other city archives. The case of the deportation of a few thousand Jews from Antwerp to communities in the adjacent province of Limburg at the end of 1940 illustrates this. They were allowed to return after a few months, but their stay obviously left traces in some of the local archives. These archives can be identified using (local) studies on this very specific subject, but these are very small archives with sometimes very limited collections on the Holocaust period. The foreigners’ files are accessible via name registers, organised according to date of arrival in Belgium. It should be noted that public administrations in Belgium were (and are still) not allowed to register ethnic or religious background. None of the official pre- or post-war sources therefore mention “Jew” or “Jewishness” (unlike in the neighbouring Netherlands, for example, where religion was duly registered).\r\n\r\nIndeed, this access via names – instead of, for example, by topic – poses one of the most important challenges to locating both victim and perpetrator sources in Belgium. Important victim sources are held by the Directorate-General War for Victims, a state institution, originally founded by the Ministry of Reconstruction and now part of the State Archives. Its task was to gather information on war victims in different military archives, judicial archives, etc., in order to obtain settlement and/or victim recognition. It thus built up a huge collection of personal files and files on some organisations, such as the Jewish resistance. There is no online catalogue, only a card index system which is not publicly accessible. It is alphabetically ordered, so one has to know the name of the person whose files he or she is looking for and there are no specific references to the persecution of the Jews. There is also an inventory, but using it does not resolve the issues mentioned above.\r\n\r\nSimilar problems arise in the case of one the most important archives for the study of the perpetrators. The archives of the former Military Justice system, which hold the files of the post-war trials of war criminals and collaborators, have been transferred to the National Archives but are not publicly accessible, consultation requiring the authorisation of the *Collège des procureurs généraux/College van procureurs-generaal*. Access is generally granted for researchers, the individuals concerned and their descendants. A research guide and summary finding aid exist.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Belgium**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Belgium**\r\n\r\nEHRI's identification and investigation work in Belgium was based on a three-pronged approach:\r\n\r\n1. Actively identifying repositories (and collections, in the case of CEGESOMA) via the bibliographies of key publications on the subject.\r\n\r\n2. Providing Kazerne Dossin – Memorial, Museum and Documentation Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights with know-how and assistance to provide shareable descriptions of its sources that meet international archival standards.\r\n\r\n3. Working closely together with the authors and directors of the research guide on *Sources pour l'histoire des populations juives et du judaïsme en Belgique/Bronnen voor de geschiedenis van de Joden en het Jodendom in België, 19de-21ste eeuw*\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the identification of repositories holding Holocaust-related collections was dramatically improved by EHRI’s identification work, both via its own identification work based on the abovementioned reference works and through cooperation with the National Archives and their research guide authors. At the start of EHRI, the Directory of Holocaust-Related Archives of the Claims Conference listed 7 Belgian archives while the *Guide éuropeen des sources d’archives de la Shoah* provided information on 9 repositories. EHRI's portal now contains information on over 120 repositories, most of them with detailed information.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the huge gap that had to be covered has much to do with the belated interest in Holocaust documentation and research in Belgium. CEGESOMA was created in the late 1960s, which is rather late compared to similar institutions in other countries, such as NIOD in the Netherlands. Moreover, although the persecution of Jews during the Second World War was always present both in the collections and in research, it was never a central focus point. This delayed interest was very much visible when EHRI started its activities. EHRI's activities coincided with the beginnings of a research guide to Jewish sources at the National Archives, and the opening of Kazerne Dossin, so the project started precisely at a time when the topic was finally receiving wide attention in Belgium from academic, archival and public perspectives.\r\n\r\n**_Identification of collections_**\r\n\r\n*Kazerne Dossin*\r\n\r\nDue to the aforementioned challenges, the first point of call of any research on the persecution of Jews in Belgium should be Kazerne Dossin. Kazerne Dossin was originally established in the mid-1990s as the Jewish Museum of Deportation and Resistance and was located in the former transit camp Dossin in Mechelen. This museum and research centre actively collects material, often private collections, related to the Holocaust in Belgium. It holds the largest collection of materials on the topic in Belgium, including original, photocopied and scanned materials. Often, Kazerne Dossin can offer easier access to originals kept elsewhere, as it has, first of all, such a wide variety of sources in one central place and, secondly, because its database can trace multiple sources on one person, thereby giving easy access to scanned foreigners’ files on victims of the Holocaust (whereas in the original archives one would have to go through the register and then request the file needed, or search for the correct microfilm) or other sources. Consulting these sources in the original repository, would require considerable effort in terms of administration and identification. Moreover, Kazerne Dossin keeps track of ongoing research and employs a team of experts in the field.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite the wealth of its sources, the archives of Kazerne Dossin remained relatively unknown to the outside world until 2015 because of the limited information available via finding aids. On its website, Kazerne Dossin originally only provided one text describing its main collections, which was regularly updated: The number of described collections fluctuated between 9 and 17 and the identifier numbers attached to the collection descriptions changed. Many of the materials – often precious private sources from victims or survivors, donated to the museum – remained hidden behind generic descriptions such as “Museum’s collection” or were only described in a separate Word document, stored in a folder together with the scans of the originals and only accessible to staff. EHRI supported Kazerne Dossin by helping them transfer the existing texts into archival descriptions according to international archival standards, and integrate new descriptions into this system. This resulted in a major step forward for Kazerne Dossin: the number of collection descriptions provided to EHRI rose from 17 to over 220 descriptions and Kazerne Dossin is continuing its efforts to make all its materials publicly available on a collection level. As one of the archivists stated: “It is only since EHRI came along that people here accepted the need to work according to international archival standards”.\r\n\r\n*CEGESOMA*\r\n\r\nThe Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (CEGESOMA) also holds important Holocaust collections, such as as the archives of the Devisenschutzkommando, the records of the trial against von Falkenhausen, the Tätigkeitsberichte of the Military Administration and important files from the former Military Prosecutor's Office. Collection descriptions from CEGESOMA were selected via keyword selection and literature search (verification of bibliographies of key works on the Holocaust in Belgium) and integrated by EHRI's IT specialists. The export includes archival documents, manuscripts, interview descriptions, and photo descriptions.\r\n\r\n*Sources pour l'histoire des populations juives et du judaïsme en Belgique/Bronnen voor de geschiedenis van de Joden en het Jodendom in België, 19de-21ste eeuw*\r\n\r\nThis archival guide was analysed and the descriptions relevant to the EHRI project, both in Belgium and abroad, were selected and added to the EHRI portal.\r\n\r\n**C.II.In other countries**\r\n\r\nMany sources are stored in repositories outside of Belgium. First of all, there are the archives of the JDC (with branches in New York and Jerusalem) and of the World Jewish Congress records on Belgium (stored at the Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati). Original documents of the Belgian Jewish Committee in London during the Second World War are available at Yad Vashem (M.22). This committee, founded in 1943 in London by Herman Schamisso, unified a group of Belgian Jewish exiles in London. Their records contain correspondence with various Jewish institutions in Belgium, England, the US and elsewhere. They also contain correspondence with the Belgian government-in-exile about ways of assisting Jews in Belgium and Jews from Belgium in exile abroad. Furthermore, the records include lists of deportees and survivors. In addition to this rich collection, Yad Vashem has both original and copied documents on Jews in Belgium, including on Jewish resistance (M.64, 0.29, 0.44). There are also indirect sources on Jews in Belgium, such as “Documentation regarding the Holocaust from the Central Archives in Moscow, 1939-1945” (M.40) and “Documentation of the Central British Fund” (M.56).\r\n\r\nUSHMM also holds vast materials, both originals and copies, on Jews in Belgium. Their copy collection on Belgium includes copies from Kazerne Dossin, the Directorate-General War for Victims, CEGESOMA, and the National Archives (Foreigners’ Police, *Brüsseler Treuhandgesellschaft* collection, Archive of the Diamond collection and other files). A non-exhaustive list of the copies includes: selected records from the Belgian War Crimes Tribunals and Investigation Records, selected records from the Ministry of Reconstruction of Belgium, selected records from the Belgian Royal Archives, selected records related to the Pierre Beeckmans Anti-Jewish organisation in Belgium, selected records from the City of Liège and from the *Consistoire Central Israélite de Belgique*, and records relating to the Breendonk camp. The original collections include the “Fela and Chaïm Perelman papers” (Acc.nr. 2006.432). Chaïm Perelman (a very influential philosopher in the fields of the philosophy of law and argumentation) founded the \"*Comité de Défense des Juifs*\", the Jewish underground in Belgium. Both Chaïm and Fela worked for the underground during the war. Fela opened a kindergarten called \"Nos Petits\" in 1942 and when the school closed she made efforts to hide Jewish children.\r\n\r\nGerman sources on Belgium during the Second World War are stored at, among other places, the French National Archives at Pierrefitte-sur-Seine (sub-series AJ40), and the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv Freiburg.\r\n\r\n",

                "history": "Bulgaria joined the Axis alliance in March 1941 and entered the Second World War following Germany’s campaign against Yugoslavia and Greece in April 1941. Territories in both occupied countries came under Bulgarian military and civilian administration. Bulgaria’s involvement in the wars of the Axis, however, did not go any further. Bulgaria did not join Hitler’s war against the Soviet Union; it did not sever diplomatic ties with the Soviets. In August 1944, Bulgaria began to distance itself from the Axis. The government declared war on Germany on 8 September 1944, only to be overthrown by a communist coup one day later as the Red Army entered Bulgarian territory.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Second World War, Bulgaria had 6,341,000 inhabitants. Among them were some 48,000 Jews, most of whom lived in the capital Sofia. In January 1941, the pro-Nazi government, despite public opposition, introduced the antisemitic “Law for the Protection of the Nation” which put numerous restrictions on the country’s Jews. It was implemented by the specially created Commissariat for Jewish Affairs [Komisarstvo po Evreyskite Vuprosi, KEV]. After 1941, all Jewish men between 20 and 45 years of age were drafted for forced labour and mainly put to work building roads and railways. In February 1943, the head of the KEV, Alexander Belev, and the German SS-Plenipotentiary Theodor Dannecker signed an agreement for the deportation of 20,000 Jews from Bulgaria’s “new territories”, in Macedonia and Thrace. Since there were not enough Jews in these areas (slightly above 11,000) to reach this figure, the rest were to be taken from a number of towns in Bulgaria. 11,343 Macedonian and Thracian Jews were deported by Bulgarian and German authorities to Treblinka and murdered there in March 1943, but no Jews from Bulgaria proper. The Bulgarian government resumed planning to meet the German demands for the deportation of Jews from Bulgaria in May 1943 (which met with public protest). The Bulgarian Jews, except those who lived abroad under German occupation and were denied Bulgarian help, survived despite the hardship of the war years. Anti-Jewish laws were formally repealed in late August 1944. At the end of the war, 49,172 Jews lived within the old boundaries of Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nAccording to a 1934 census, there were 149,385 Roma living mostly in villages in Bulgaria. Roma communities were subject to discrimination, forced labour, and restricted movement. Roma living in Bulgarian occupied territories were subject to various kinds of persecution\r\n",
                "summary": "The most important institution supervising Holocaust-relevant archival collections in Bulgaria is the Archives State Agency (ASA) in Sofia. Their Guidebooks to the archives (14 volumes so far) offers guidance through the available material and is accessible online via:\r\n\r\n- [http://archives.bg/jews/](http://archives.bg/jews/)\r\n- [Search page](http://212.122.187.196:84/FundSearch.aspx)\r\n- [Overview of guides published by the Archives State Agency](http://www.archives.government.bg/443-%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%B6%D1%82%D0%B5%20%D0%B8%20%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%20%D0%BF%D1%8A%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D0%94%D1%8A%D1%80%D0%B6%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F)\r\n\r\nBeyond the Central State Archive, the Organisation of Jews in Bulgaria “Shalom” [Organizatsia na evreite v Bulgaria “Shalom”], also located in Sofia, may be relevant for Holocaust-related research. Other Central and Regional Archives also hold Holocaust-related documents. These are Military Archive in Veliko Tarnovo and also the regional branches of the Central State Archive. Outside of Bulgaria, relevant material from the Holocaust-period can be found in a number of institutions. EHRI was able to identify, among other institutions, the German Bundesarchiv in Berlin Lichterfelde and in Freiburg, the Politisches Archiv des Auswärtigen Amtes, and Yad Vashem in Israel. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has copied a considerable quantity of Holocaust-relevant archival material from Bulgaria based on the collection of the Archives State Agency. Finding aids are accessible through the USHMM’s website (links are provided in the EHRI portal).\r\n",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Bulgaria: Pre-existing research and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nDocumentary databases (resources) regarding the history of Jews in Bulgaria exist in Yad Vashem, USHMM, Centropa and, most of all, in the Bulgarian Archives State Agency and many other archival institutions in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Bulgarian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nBulgaria has a centralised archival system. The state archival institution has changed its name and departmental subordination several times. Now known as the Archives State Agency, its current status is regulated by National Archival Fonds Act, which was adopted in 2007. The organisation of and procedures governing access to the archival records are regulated by the [Law on the National Archival Fonds](http://www.archives.government.bg/images/1279111646.doc), the [Regulation on the procedures for use the records of the National Archival Fonds](http://www.archives.government.bg/uploaded_files/Regulation_USE__EN.pdf) and the [Rules for the procedures and organization of the archival records' use in Archives State Agency (ASA)](http://www.archives.government.bg/uploaded_files/Rules-order_and_organization_of_the_use.doc). All Bulgarian and foreign physical and juridical persons may use the records held by the ASA. The structure of the ASA includes a central archive and six directorates in the regional centres of Burgas, Varna, Tarnovo, Plovdiv, Montana and Sofia. Under them are all the other 27 regional archival branches of ASA. Several other archival institutions contain documents concerning the fate of Jews in Bulgaria during the Second World War. These are the State Military Historical Archives in the city of Veliko Turnovo, the Sofia City Archive, the Archive of the Bulgarian Academy of Science, as well archives in other countries. The most significant collections outside Bulgaria can be found in Yad Vashem, USHMM and different archives in Germany and Russia. The most important information for all future researchers is the expanding digital access to huge collection of archival documents concerning the fate of the Jews in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Bulgaria**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Bulgaria**\r\n\r\nThe Central State Archives and the regional archives hold different collections connected to the persecution and protection of the Bulgarian Jews during the Second World War as well as the deportation of the Macedonian and Thracian Jews. The biggest and most important among them are the record groups of the Commissariat for the Jewish Affairs. All archives are open to researchers and users. The entire collection is in the process of digitisation. Digital open access is provided, and referred to in the EHRI archival descriptions. Given the huge volume of documents, EHRI’s main aim for Bulgaria has been to present up-to-date and accurate information on the structure of the archives, contacts, logistical information, as well as a description of the volume of documents and a general content description of the main branches of the State Agency Archives and of the Central State Archives itself. EHRI has been able to provide up-to-date summaries of the structure of the fonds, the quantities of documents, as well as descriptions of a small number of representative archival units in these inventories. For example, the Fonds of Commissariat of Jewish Affairs [Комисарство по еврейските въпроси – КЕВ], which is available at the State Archives Agency, contains 15,348 archival units organised in three inventories. The EHRI portal includes links to the Archives State Agency for a number of digitized documents concerning the persecution and protection of Jews in Bulgaria during the Second World War.\r\n\r\n**C.II. Outside of Bulgaria**\r\n\r\nEHRI was able to identify, among other institutions, the German Bundesarchiv in Berlin Lichterfelde and Freiburg, the Politisches Archiv des Auswärtigen Amtes, and Yad Vashem in Israel. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has copied a considerable quantity of Holocaust-relevant archival material from Bulgaria based on the collection of the State Agency Archives.

                "history": "The territory of what is present-day Belarus was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793. In January 1919, the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed. After the Polish-Soviet War of 1920, the western regions of Belarus, including the cities of Brest, Hrodna, Nowogródek (Navahrudak) and Pinsk, were incorporated into Poland, while the east remained part of the Soviet Union. Following the Ribbentrop-Molotov Agreement, the Red Army occupied eastern Poland in September 1939 and reclaimed previously lost territory. When German armies crossed the Soviet border on 22 June 1941, they seized the capital of the Belarusian Soviet Republic, Minsk, within a week. By September 1941, Germany controlled all of Belarus. The western part of the occupied Soviet Republic came under a civilian administration, while the east was administered by the military. The territory under civilian administration was divided between the White Ruthenia General District (the main portion of the territory) and the Lithuania General District (the north-western part), both subordinate to Reichskommissariat Ostland. Other areas were attached to Reichskommissariat Ukraine (in the South) and the Białystok District, which was attached to the German Gau East Prussia (in the North-West). The Red Army ended the German occupation of Belarus in August 1944. Belarus declared independence from the USSR in August 1991.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the German invasion, the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic had an estimated total population of 9,200,000 people. About 700,000 of them were Jews. According to various estimates, between 153,000 and 165,000 Jews from Belarus managed to flee or were evacuated when Germany invaded. The main perpetrators of the murder campaign were members of Einsatzgruppen A and B and the Security and Order Police stationed in Belarus. Most of the Jews in Belarus were exterminated in two major waves: between the late summer and winter of 1941 and during 1942. As the scope of mass murder widened, the Germans increasingly relied on local collaborators and collaborating organizations. The last Jewish ghettos in Western Belarus were liquidated in the summer of 1942, while the Minsk Ghetto, one of the largest in Europe, was fully liquidated by October 1943. The percentage of Jews who perished in Belarus during the Holocaust is among the highest in Europe. The number of victims has been estimated to be at least 450,000 and may be in the range of 600,000, including Jewish refugees from Poland. In Belarus, the Germans not only murdered Jews living in the country, but also Jews from the Reich or Bohemia who were deported or escaped to Belarus from all over Europe.\r\n\r\nRoma have had a presence in what is today Belarus since the 15th century. According to a Soviet census conducted in 1939, there were 3,362 Roma living in the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (BSSR). The actual number was higher because the western parts of Belarus belonged to Poland at the time (and no census data exists for this area) and some Roma were registered as Belarusians or Russians. Little is known about the history of Roma living in the western parts of Belarus under Soviet rule between September 1939 and June 1941. Under German occupation, Roma communities were subject to displacement, forced labour, and concentration. Most were killed on the spot in summary executions and mass shootings by both German soldiers and local collaborators. It is estimated that at least 3,000 Belorussian Roma were killed.",
                "summary": "EHRI has identified a number of helpful archival guides on Belarus, some of which are available online. A list is provided in the EHRI extensive report on Belarus. EHRI established contact with central Belarusian archival authorities to facilitate future exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in the country.\r\n\r\nThe most important Belarusian archives for Holocaust research include the National Archives of the Republic of Belarus. Their collections cover German occupation organizations, Communist Party and Partisan organization files as well as the post-Liberation investigations of the Belarusian Extraordinary State Committee to Investigate German Fascist Crimes Committed on Soviet Territory. Similar files of a more local provenance are contained in the Regional Archives in Viciebsk, Mahilioŭ, Homiel, Hrodna and, most importantly, Brest, where larger collections containing material of Jewish origin also exist. EHRI has identified over 25 archival institutions in Belarus which hold Holocaust-relevant material. Seven of them are located in the country’s capital Minsk. For a complete list, see the EHRI extensive report on Belarus.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there are regional, “zonal” or otherwise specialized archives with Holocaust-relevant collections which can be found in 14 urban centers of Belarus, namely in Baranavičy, Babrujsk, Barysaŭ, Brest, Hlybokaje, Homiel, Kobryn, Lida, Mazyr, Orša, Pinsk, Polack, Rečyca and Viciebsk. They are also listed in the EHRI extensive report on Belarus. Based on a published finding aid, EHRI has identified over 230 collections spread over several repositories.\r\n\r\nOutside of Belarus, EHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections that may prove relevant to Holocaust research on Belarus, for instance in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Russia. In Israel, Yad Vashem holds significant documentation from archives in Belarus from 1930 to 1960, containing over 4,000 files. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum stores selected records from the Belarus Central State Archives and from the Homiel, Hrodna and Mahilioŭ regional archives.\r\n",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Belarus: Pre-existing research, available archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nEHRI’s exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in Belarus relied on some important pre-existing research in the field, such as Christian Gerlach’s *Kalkulierte Morde. Die deutsche Wirtschafts- und Vernichtungspolitik in Weißrußland 1941-1944* (1998), which had already made use of archival material available in the country. EHRI was also able to identify a number of helpful archival guides, some of which are available online.\r\n\r\nFor a general overview, which is also available in English, see:\r\n\r\nhttp://archives.gov.by/eng\r\n\r\nMore specialised archival guides include:\r\n\r\n- [2007] Stefan Karner & Vjačeslav Selemenev (Hg.), *Österreicher und Sudetendeutsche vor sowjetischen Militär- und Strafgerichten in Weißrussland 1945–1950* (Graz – Minsk, 2007). This guide provides information about the post-war trials\r\n\r\n- [2003] Kupovetsky, Mark, Eduard Savitsky & Marek Web (eds.), *Dokumenty po istorii i kulture evreev v arkhivach Belarusi* (Documents on the history and culture of Jews in the archives of Belarus) (Moscow: RGGU, 2003)\r\n\r\n- [2003] Zumar, Sergej V., *Dokumente zur Geschichte des Zweiten Weltkrieges in den Staatsarchiven der Republik Belarus. Ein Nachschlagewerk / Dokumenty po istorii Velikoi Otechestvennoi voiny v gosudarstvennykh arkhivach Respubliki Belarus* (Dresden: Ludwig-Boltzmann-Institut / Komitee f. Archiv- u. Schriftführung / Belarussisches Wissenschaftsforschungsinstitut / Nationalarchiv d. Republik Belarus / Stiftung Sächsische Gedenkstätten, 2003). This guide is available online, albeit only in Russian: http://archives.gov.by/index.php?id=156936\r\n\r\n- [1996] Sallis, Dorit & Marek Web (eds.), *Jewish Documentary Sources in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus: A Preliminary List* (New York: JTS, 1996).\r\nEHRI has also established contact with central Belarusian archival authorities in order to facilitate future exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in the country, whose full extent and importance have yet to be determined\r\n\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Belarusian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nMost of the central and regional Belarusian archives were founded during the pre-war Soviet period and suffered, to some extent, from fighting, evacuation or occupation. A smaller number of archival institutions was created and began to operate immediately after the German occupiers’ withdrawal from Belarus. There are also some more recently established archival institutions. As a result of regime changes and administrative reforms, many archival institutions in Belarus have been repeatedly renamed, which may cause some initial confusion among researchers.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Belarus**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Belarus**\r\n\r\nIn Belarus, EHRI identified over 25 archival institutions which hold or may hold Holocaust-relevant material on Belarus. Many of them are concentrated in the country’s capital, Minsk, and environs. Among the numerous provincial centres, the cities of Hrodna and Mahilioŭ each host two Holocaust-relevant archival institutions. Regional, zonal and otherwise specialised archives can be found in all other urban centres of Belarus, i.e. in Baranavičy (Baranovichi), Babrujsk (Bobruisk), Barysaŭ (Borisov), Brest, Dziaržynsk (Dzerzhinsk), Hlybokaje (Glubokoe), Homiel (Gomel), Kobryn (Kobrin), Lida, Mazyr (Mozyr), Orša (Orsha), Pinsk, Polack (Polotsk), Rečyca (Rechitsa) and Viciebsk (Vitebsk).\r\n\r\nThe abovementioned Belarusian archives hold vast numbers of valuable records on all conceivable aspects of the country’s general history: the Minsk-based National Archives alone stores about 1,200 fonds, and almost all regional or zonal archives hold similarly impressive numbers of collections. Given the dimension of mass murder in Belarus during the Second World War, many Holocaust-relevant collections are either known to be stored or can be expected to be found in the country’s archives. On the basis of Sergej V Zumar’s *Dokumente zur Geschichte des Zweiten Weltkrieges in den Staatsarchiven der Republik Belarus. Ein Nachschlagewerk / Dokumenty po istorii Velikoi Otechestvennoi voiny v gosudarstvennykh arkhivach Respubliki Belarus* (2003), EHRI has selected Holocaust-relevant collections among the general mass of sources in Belarus. The descriptions of these selected collections have been copied from the Belarusian online archival catalogue (http://fk.archives.gov.by/catalogue/).\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Belarus, EHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections that may prove relevant to Holocaust research on Belarus, for instance in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Russia. In Israel, Yad Vashem holds a significant documentation from archives in Belarus from 1930 to 1960, containing over 4,000 files. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum stores selected records from the Belarus Central State Archives and from the Homiel, Hrodna and Mahilioŭ regional archives.\r\n",

Under the leadership of Liberal Prime Minister William Mackenzie King, the federal government set up highly restrictive and ethnically selective immigration policy. For the period 1933-1945, between 5,000 and 10,000 Jewish migrants were accepted into the country, many of whom arrived before the war started. During the war, the arrivals were very limited; some 2,000 German and Austrian Jewish “enemy aliens” were transported from Great Britain and interned in Canada, and 400 refugees came from Spain and Portugal in 1944. Conversely, after the war, Holocaust survivors became one of the immediate post-war era’s largest migrant categories: From 1947 to 1955, 35,000 of them resettled in Canada. \r\n\r\nFor this country there are no sufficient findings on the history of Roma during the Second World War. EHRI would be pleased to receive any information.\r\n",
                "summary": "Library and Archives Canada is one of the country’s most important institutions for Holocaust-related material, largely thanks to the sources it holds concerning the Canadian military forces’ liberation of concentration camps. Additionally, other important sources may be found in military archives, Jewish survivor archives and war crime investigation archives from the 1990s. Specifically, EHRI notes that Holocaust-related materials can be found at the Alex Dworkin Canadian Jewish Archives in Montreal, as well as at the Jewish Public Library Archives of Montreal, the Montreal Holocaust Museum, the Ontario Jewish Archives in Toronto, and the Vancouver Holocaust Education Centre. The EHRI Portal provides archival descriptions for material held by the Alex Dworkin Canadian Jewish Archives, the Jewish Public Library, the Ottawa Jewish Archives, and the Vancouver Holocaust Education Centre, including Jewish immigrants’ personal papers and the Yom Hashoah Holocaust Remembrance Committee (formerly the Warsaw Ghetto Committee) fonds. EHRI has also described the Michael Marrus (a world-leading Holocaust scholar) fonds held by the University of Toronto Archives and Records Management Services.",

                "history": "When Germany invaded Poland, the Swiss Federal Council called for general mobilisation and formally declared neutrality. The Parliament elected a war-time commander-in-chief of the army who, along with the Federal Council, issued joint orders to resist any invader in April 1940. German plans to outflank the French through Swiss territory were dismissed. While Switzerland enjoyed the double advantage of being a secondary objective for the Axis powers and of being able to deter attackers thanks to difficult terrain and quite a formidable military force, the country found itself effectively surrounded by Axis territory after the fall of France. The last remaining exit was closed off after the German occupation of Vichy France in November 1942. Switzerland maintained armed neutrality throughout the Second World War.\r\n\r\nBefore the war, Switzerland had a total population of about 4,066,400 people. Some 19,000 of them were Jews (half Swiss, half foreign-born). While Switzerland provided asylum to political refugees from Germany after 1933, Swiss authorities did not consider “racial” persecution a valid reason for asylum. While some 30,000 Jewish refugees who reached Switzerland during the war were admitted, approximately the same number was turned back at the border. At the end of the war, as part of efforts to aid concentration camp prisoners, Switzerland accepted transports of Jewish prisoners from various camps, including Bergen-Belsen, Theresienstadt and Buchenwald.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland imposed several anti-Roma policies prior to the First World War such as prohibiting Sinti and Roma from traveling by rail or boat, a ban on entering the country, and identification through an official registry. During the Second World War, refugees of the minority were returned to Nazi Germany or imprisoned while awaiting expulsion. Those who were already Swiss residents faced forced sterilization and abortions. The 1906 ban on Romani people entering Switzerland was lifted in 1972.",
                "summary": "EHRI has determined that the Federal Archives of Switzerland hold war-time collections of Swiss diplomats posted throughout occupied Europe, the Swiss military authorities, the Swiss commission of doctors and private contacts. They also contain lists with the names and identities of those Jews who were rejected at the Swiss borders. Other Swiss archives with Holocaust-related collections can be found in Canton and city archives. Moreover, the Dokumentationsstelle Jüdische Zeitgeschichte of the Archives of Contemporary History of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich collects sources on the Holocaust and Jewish History including refugee issues. The archive of the Swiss History Society [Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Geschichte] may also hold Holocaust-relevant material. Furthermore, highly important archives of international organisations are located in Switzerland, such as the archives of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the archives of the League of Nations Archives in Geneva. EHRI has identified two helpful archival guides, both of them in German: [*Archive in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz.

                "history": "The Bohemian lands (Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia) were part of the Habsburg monarchy until the First World War, and of the First Czechoslovak Republic between 1918 and 1938. Following the signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938, the border territories along the nowadays German and Austrian frontier were annexed by Germany (and a small part of Silesia by Poland). Most of these areas were reorganized as the Reichsgau Sudetenland, while areas in the West and South were attached to neighboring German Gaue. Further territorial losses between September and November 1938, led to the federalisation of Czechoslovakia (Czecho-Slovakia). In March 1939 Nazi Germany occupied the rest of the Bohemian lands, creating the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, with its own government and administration under close German supervision. The German-occupied Protectorate functioned up to the end of the war in May 1945.\r\n\r\nIn 1939, the Bohemian lands had a total population of about 11 million inhabitants (10,674,386 according to the 1930 census). After the Munich Agreement, most of the approximately 25,000 Jews from Sudetenland escaped or were expelled into the interior of the country. In the Protectorate, the occupiers regarded some 118,000 inhabitants as Jews. This Jewish community had modernized and had largely assimilated with German and Czech society in the Bohemian lands. In the context of rising nationalism and antisemitism, the first exclusionary measures were already taken during the Second Republic (1938-39). After the occupation, the Germans, as well as the semi-autonomous authorities of the Protectorate, imposed laws and various ordinances to discriminate against Jews and confiscate their property. In autumn 1939, some 5,000 Jews were deported from Vienna and Ostrava to Nisko. Before further emigration was banned in 1941, 26,000 Jews emigrated legally and several more illegally from the Protectorate. In 1941-42 several thousand Jews were deported to the ghettos of Litzmannstadt, Riga and Minsk, where they shared the history of the local Jewish population. In November 1941 the Theresienstadt [Terezín] ghetto was created; over 80,000 Jews from the Bohemian lands, but also more than 60,000 from Germany, Austria, and other Nazi-controlled territories were deported there between 1942 and 1945. Theresienstadt became a transit ghetto, because most of the prisoners were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau and other extermination camps. About 33,000 Theresienstadt (mostly elderly) inmates perished in the ghetto due to the harsh conditions. In 1943-44, approximately 17,500 prisoners were deported to the Theresienstadt Family Camp in Auschwitz-Birkenau which was probably created for propaganda purposes. Most of the prisoners were killed in two large actions. At the end of the war there were 2,800 Jews in the Bohemian lands (most of them from “mixed” families), but the number of survivors was larger (about 14,000, together with the surviving deportees). Altogether, about 80,000 Czech Jews perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nDuring the interwar period, approximately 70–100,000 Roma lived in the territories of the whole Czechoslovak Republic. The vast majority lived in Slovakia. After the Anschluss in 1938, anti-Roma sentiment radicalized, and the population faced increasing discrimination. After the establishment of the Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia in 1939, legislation and praxis towards Roma and Sinti was adjusted to the regulations already valid in Germany. Around 6,500 Roma were racially categorised by official authorities, many were deported into the detention camps Lety near Pisek and Hodonin near Kunstadt and later deported to Auschwitz. The Roma population in Bohemia and Moravia was almost completely destroyed. ",
                "summary": "Collections relating to the Second World War and the Holocaust can be found not only in the abovementioned archives, but also in the Military History Archives, the National Film Archives, the Archive of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and the State Security Archives (which holds the archives of the former communist security services and extensive materials from the Ministry of the Interior, including the criminal police) and municipal archives. Furthermore, there is the Terezín Memorial in the former Theresienstadt ghetto which acts as a museum, archive and research institute. Non-state institutions doing research and collecting documents on the Holocaust include the Jewish Museum in Prague and the Terezin Initiative Institute, also based in Prague, which was founded by former inmates of the Theresienstadt ghetto. EHRI has identified a number of archival guides on Czechia which are listed in the extensive report. EHRI has prepared a Terezín [Theresienstadt] Research Guide which links together the fragmented collections on this ghetto, interprets their history and provides contextual information. The “Jewish Councils” Research Guide also contains data about relevant collections in Czechia.",
                "extensive": "Disclaimer: The EHRI Extensive Report was updated in 2024.\r\n\r\n**A. EHRI approach to Czechia: Pre-existing Research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Czechia, EHRI was able to rely on a number of pre-existing works, including Livia Rothkirchen’s *The Jews of Bohemia and Moravia. Facing the Holocaust* (2005), works by Miroslav Kárný, the Theresienstädter Studien und Dokumente and other publications. EHRI identified a number of resources useful for Holocaust researchers:\r\n- [2008] Sedláková, Monika. “Co skrývají Okupační vězeňské spisy” in *Terezínské listy* 36 (2008): 198–210.\r\n- [2005] Ptáčníková, Světlana/Vaničková, Vladimíra, “Judaika v Archivu Ministerstva vnitra” in *Sborník Archivu Ministerstva vnitra* 3 (2005): 321-342.\r\n- [2005] Tůma, Oldřich/Jitka Svobodová/Ulrich Mählert, Vademecum Contemporary History Czech Republic. *A Guide to Archives, Research Institutions, Libraries, Associations, Museums and Places of Memorial* (Prague: Institute for Contemporary History, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, 2005).\r\n- [1987] *Státní ústřední archiv v Praze. Průvodce po archivních fondech a sbírkách* (Praha: TEPS, 1987).\r\n- The [National Archives Portal](https://portal.nacr.cz/cro/en/) is the central database of archival collections in Czechia.\r\n- Holocaust.cz portal provides access, apart from other materials, to the database of Holocaust victims and to a growing body of digitised archival material (mostly from the National Archives, but also from other archival institutions).\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Czech archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe Archival system in Czechia consists of the state archives, particularly the National Archives in Prague, and 7 regional archives, which are subordinate to the National Archival Administration [Odbor archivní správy a spisové služby] of the Ministry of Interior. Two other archives, in Opava and Brno, are also de facto regional archives, but are called Zemský, or Land archives, for historical reasons. Furthermore, there are 70 district archives which are subordinated to the respective regional archives. In addition to the mentioned archives, there exist also several specialed and private archives, memory institutions, museums and libraries. Furthermore, there are five archives of the territorial self-governing units worth emphasising, in Prague, Brno, Ostrava, Plzeň and Ústí nad Labem.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Czechia** \r\n\r\n**C. I. In Czechia** \r\n\r\nCollections relating to the Second World War and the Holocaust can be found not only in the abovementioned state archives, but also in the Military History Archives, the National Film Archives, the Archive of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and the State Security Archive (which holds the archives of the former communist security services). Furthermore, there is the Terezín Memorial in the former Theresienstadt ghetto which acts as a museum, archive and research institute. Non-state institutions doing research and collecting documents on the Holocaust include the Jewish Museum in Prague and the Prague-based Terezín Initiative Institute, which was founded by former inmates of the Theresienstadt ghetto. In October 2018, EHRI imported 165 top-level archival descriptions prepared by the Jewish Museum in Prague within the framework of the cooperation between EHRI and the [Yerusha project](http://yerusha.eu/).\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nEHRI has yet to determine which archival institutions and collections outside of Czechia are relevant to Holocaust research on Czechia. Some holdings of Yad Vashem and Beit Terezin (Israel) have been included in the [EHRI research guides](https://portal.ehri-project.eu/guides/terezin). The USHMM has conducted an extended copying program in the Czech archives, in particular in the National Archives in Prague. Yad Vashem has copied a significant amount of material from the Archives of the Jewish Museum in Prague.\r\n",

                "history": "Adolf Hitler was appointed Reich Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Within half a year, his National Socialist German Workers’ Party succeeded in establishing a one-party dictatorship. Political enemies of the Nazis were taken into “protective custody” and held in concentration camps under emergency regulations. After the death of Reich President Paul von Hindenburg in 1934, Hitler declared himself head of state. As of 1938, the German Reich expanded by force, annexing Austria and the Czech Sudetenland. It seized the remaining Czech lands in March 1939. In September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, thus provoking declarations of war by Poland’s allies Great Britain and France. During the ensuing Second World War, German troops occupied much of continental Europe. Throughout the areas under German control and in territories controlled by its allies, apparent and actual resisters, as well as “racial” undesirables, were persecuted and murdered. Most German territory was occupied by the Allies by the spring of 1945. The German army unconditionally surrendered to the Allies in May 1945.\r\n\r\nIn early 1933, the German Reich had a total population of over 65 million inhabitants. About 552,000 of them were adherents of the Jewish faith. Many of them opted for emigration when they were threatened by Hitler’s rise to power. As antisemitism was a cornerstone of his Nazi Party’s ideology, it was quickly put into practice. Supported by a prevalent antisemitic sentiment in Germany, the Nazis propagated their pseudo-scientific “racial” anti-Jewish beliefs, managing to exclude German Jews both socially and economically: According to the May 1939 census, which applied “racial” criteria, there remained approximately 242,000 so-called “full Jews”, some 20,000 of whom were not adherents of the Jewish faith. The Nazis considered 85,000 other people as “half-Jews” and “quarter-Jews”, in other words, people with a certain degree of Jewish descent.\r\n\r\nIn April 1933, a Reich-wide boycott of Jewish businesses was implemented and all Jews were dismissed from state employment. In 1935, the racist Nuremberg Laws forbade marital and sexual relations between Germans of non-Jewish descent and those of Jewish descent, unless they were already married. Jewish businesses and properties were subject to “Aryanisation”, which amounted to full-scale expropriation of the Jews in Germany. After leaving behind most of their possessions, many of those who successfully emigrated from Germany during the 1930s settled in European countries which were later affected by the Holocaust. During a Reich-wide pogrom in November 1938, practically all synagogues in Germany were systematically attacked and destroyed, Jewish shops and homes looted, hundreds killed and some 30,000 Jewish men taken to concentration camps. German antisemitic ideology and propaganda increasingly affected Germany’s allies and spread to all occupied areas.\r\n\r\nAfter the start of the war, the remaining 214,000 Jews in Germany were almost completely isolated, suffered from radically reduced rations and soon had to move to special “Jewish houses”. They were now obliged to join the Reich Association of Jews in Germany [“Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland”], which was overseen by the Gestapo; many Jews were subjected to forced labor and the first attempts at mass deportations were made in 1939/40. In autumn 1941 the obligatory “Jewish Star” was introduced and the few remaining possibilities of emigration were shut off. For all but a small minority of Jews, mostly those protected by so-called “mixed” marriages, the deportations “to the East” began. There, they were either murdered upon arrival or temporarily left in impossible living conditions. Ultimately, those who survived were sent on to extermination camps. Very few of the deportees survived the war. Most early deportations went to the Reichskommissariat Ostland, the Litzmannstadt Ghetto or camps and ghettos in the General Government in occupied Poland; later deportations were mostly directed to the Theresienstadt Ghetto or went straight to Auschwitz. As of mid-1943, the Reich was declared “free of Jews”; the remaining 20,000 Jews, most of them in “mixed marriages” or of “mixed race”, were completely excised from German law and entirely subject to the Gestapo. Only very few were able to go into hiding. Beginning in mid-1944, up to 200,000 Jewish forced laborers, mostly of east-central European descent, were brought from camps and ghettos outside the Reich to concentration camps inside Germany. As the Allies approached the Reich, members of the large Jewish prisoners’ group in particular were forced on so-called death marches and many died. Overall, about 130,000 Jews deported from Germany (and 35,000 German Jews deported from other countries) perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nThe approximately 20,000 Sinti and Roma (1933) were also excluded from the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" as a \"foreign race\" in accordance with the Nuremberg Laws. The first mass deportations to concentration camps began in the summer of 1938, and a systematic total registration of the entire minority started in the fall of 1938, which was implemented by the criminal police in close cooperation with the Racial Hygiene Research Unit in Berlin. In May 1940, the first family by family deportation of around 2,500 Sinti and Roma to German-occupied Poland took place, and in December 1942, Heinrich Himmler ordered the transfer of all Sinti and Roma to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration and extermination camp. Around 15,000 German Sinti and Roma were murdered, and around 2,000 Sinti and Roma were forcibly sterilized.",
                "summary": "Key institutions identified by EHRI include the Bundesarchiv [Federal Archive with all its departments] and the respective state archives [Landes-, Hauptstaats- and Staatsarchive] of the German Bundesländer as well as the Geheimes Staatsarchiv Berlin (for former Prussian institutions), which hold surviving files of central and regional administrative bodies, occupation authorities, the Nazi Party, personnel and membership files as well as post-war investigations. Similar holdings can be found in the Nazi period archive assembled by the East German State Security Service [Ministerium für Staatssicherheit, MfS or “Stasi”], now held by the Behörde des Bundesbeauftragten für die Unterlagen des Staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen Deutschen Demokratischen Republik (BStU). The most pertinent municipal archives to Holocaust research include the city archives of Nuremberg and Frankfurt am Main; the archives of concentration camp memorial sites (pre-eminently Buchenwald, Dachau and Sachsenhausen), other memorials (Stiftung Denkmal, Haus der Wannsee-Konferenz) and research institutions such as the Institute of Contemporary History Munich-Berlin [Institut für Zeitgeschichte München-Berlin, IfZ]; the Evangelical Central Archive and the Centrum Judaicum Archiv in Berlin; and the supranational Arolsen Archives (formerly known as the International Tracing Service) in Bad Arolsen. EHRI has identified a number of guides on German archives. For an overview, see the extensive report.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Germany: Pre-existing research and archival guides**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Germany, research on the Holocaust has been conducted worldwide and for decades now. It follows that a full and up-to-date account of the available literature cannot be given here. However, a reference to the 16-volume series *Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der europäischen Juden durch das nationalsozialistische Deutschland 1933-1945* is appropriate, especially volumes 1-16 (published 2008-2018). This series is co-published by EHRI-partner Institute for Contemporary History Munich-Berlin [Institut für Zeitgeschichte München-Berlin, IfZ]. All volumes contain introductions based on international research. A translation of the series into English under the title *The Persecution and Murder of European Jews by Nazi Germany, 1933–1945* is under preparation with the cooperation of Yad Vashem; Volume 1-5, 12 were published in 2019-2022. Furthermore, there is the series Benz, Wolfgang / Distel, Barbara, *Der Ort des Terrors. Geschichte der nationalsozialistischen Konzentrationslager*, Volumes 1-9.\r\n\r\nResearch on the genocide of the Sinti and Roma began late; the most important and comprehensive publication to date is Michael Zimmermann's habilitation: *Rassenutopie und Genozid. Die nationalsozialistische Lösung der Zigeunerfrage*, Hamburg: Christians 1996 (available online at https://zeitgeschichte-hamburg.de/publikation-detail/band-33.html). Since summer 2020, the \"Encyclopaedia of the Nazi Genocide of Sinti and Roma in Europe\", which is funded by the Federal Foreign Office, has been under development at the Research Centre on Antiziganism at Heidelberg University and has set itself the task of compiling, scientifically processing and making available the existing knowledge of the persecution and murder of Sinti and Roma in Europe (see https://encyclopaedia-gsr.eu/eng/).\r\n\r\nWith the help of IfZ, EHRI has been able to identify a number of other Holocaust-relevant online resources and archival guides on Germany.\r\n\r\nAn important online resource is the Zentrale Datenbank Nachlässe, provided by the Bundesarchiv, at http://www.nachlassdatenbank.de/\r\n\r\nThe following archival guides are also available:\r\n- [2023] *Archive in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz.

Kahlenberg, Julius H. Schoeps und Hanno Loewy Verlag für Berlin-Brandenburg, Potsdam 1996-1997.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the German archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nGermany exhibits a highly differentiated archival system without much centralization. In addition to the Federal Archives and their departments (governed by the Bundesarchivgesetz or Federal Archive Law), each Bundesland has its own State Archive, governed by the respective state archive law. There are over 1,300 municipal archives. The religious communities in Germany, first and foremost bodies and organizations of the Catholic and Protestant Churches as well as the Jewish community, exhibit a rich array of archival institutions. There are also university archives, archives of noble houses and a number of other, mostly topical archives as well as libraries holding archival material.\r\n\r\nKey institutions identified by EHRI include the Bundesarchiv [Federal Archive with all its departments] and the respective state archives [Landes-, Hauptstaats- and Staatsarchive] of the German Bundesländer as well as the Geheimes Staatsarchiv Berlin (for former Prussian institutions), which hold surviving files of central and regional administrative bodies, occupation authorities, the Nazi Party, personnel and membership files as well as post-war investigations; similar holdings can be found in the Nazi period archive assembled by the East German State Security Service [“Stasi”] now held by the BStU; the most pertinent municipal archives to Holocaust research include the city archives of Nuremberg and Frankfurt am Main; the archives of concentration camp memorial sites (pre-eminently Buchenwald, Dachau and Sachsenhausen), other memorials (Stiftung Denkmal, Haus der Wannsee-Konferenz) and research institutions (such as the Institute of Contemporary History Munich–Berlin); the Evangelical Central Archive and the Centrum Judaicum Archiv in Berlin; and the supranational Arolsen Archives (formerly known as the International Tracing Service) in Bad Arolsen.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Germany**\r\n\r\n**C. I. In Germany**\r\n\r\nIn Germany, EHRI has identified well over 300 repositories, including a number of memorial sites and documentation centres concerning the Holocaust or, more generally, the “Third Reich” dictatorship.\r\n\r\nThe EHRI portal includes collection descriptions provided by Bundesarchiv (BArch), the Arolsen Archives and the Institut für Zeitgeschichte (IfZ). Additionally, collection descriptions from state archives, memorial site archives, university archives and the Central Archives Heidelberg have been added to the portal.\r\n\r\nThe Bundesarchiv is the main institution holding the remaining records generated by the central administrative bodies of the German Reich under National Socialist rule. As a first step, EHRI and the Bundesarchiv decided to focus on the Reich (“R”) and NSDAP (“NS”) record groups. Since almost all state administrations and Nazi Party organizations were involved either directly or indirectly with measures against Jews, no further selection of records was undertaken apart from a chronological one (i.e. collections with an end date of before and including 1932 were excluded from the import to the EHRI Portal). The Bundesarchiv also has extensive holdings on post-war dealings with the Holocaust (e.g. compensation and judicial issues), as well as personal collections and film and photo materials. Following an internal survey by Bundesarchiv, the most relevant collections in the remaining record groups, especially “Bund” and “Nachlässe und Sammlungen” (mostly administered in Koblenz), were added to the portal. Descriptions from the Bundesarchiv for materials that are accessible at the Politisches Archiv des Auswärtigen Amtes have also been included in the EHRI portal. The Bundesarchiv Agency in Ludwigsburg holds the prosecution files of the Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes [“Zentrale Stelle der Landesjustizverwaltungen zur Aufklärung nationalsozialistischer Verbrechen”]. These cover almost all violent crimes committed during the Nazi regime and the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nThe Arolsen Archives are an international center for documenting National Socialist persecution and the liberated survivors. Former victims of Nazism and their families receive information regarding their incarceration, forced labor, and if available, post-war Allied assistance. The archives provide the foundation for research and education. The Arolsen collections include original records generated by the ITS, correspondence, and copies from other institutions and archives that helped the ITS fulfill its tasks. Having exclusively records that deal with National Socialist persecution and its aftermath, almost all its collections are relevant to EHRI. In a first step, Arolsen’s archivists and historians and EHRI have integrated the following sets of collections into the portal:\r\n- Incarceration and persecution\r\n- Registrations of Persons of non-German Nationality by German State Authorities\r\n- Registrations and Files of Displaced Persons, Children and Missing Persons\r\n- Special NSDAP Organizations and Activities\r\n- Death Marches/Identification of unknown dead\r\n\r\nFor IfZ, the existing archive thesaurus was used for content selection. The IfZ Archive staff agreed on a selection of keywords identified as Holocaust-related that were used to select records from the IfZ database (public entries: http://archiv.ifz-muenchen.de) to be included in a data export for the EHRI portal. Unfortunately, the export of the full hierarchical list of each individual term connected with an individual record is not technically possible at this point, so that only the lowest level of the exported term is visible in the EHRI Portal. For record groups that are currently not reflected or not well reflected in the public IfZ database, collection descriptions were manually entered after coordination with the IfZ Archive.\r\n\r\nIn an ongoing multi-step survey of state archives, EHRI has added collection descriptions from West German state archives selected according to a review of Boberach [1991] to the portal manually, with the aim of allowing for future sustainable connections and deepened coverage. For East German archives, an ongoing review of Jersch-Wenzel / Reinke / Reinke [1996-2001] may serve as a similar, even more detailed basis in the future.\r\nIn cooperation with the archives of the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site, the collection descriptions which have been written up internally so far were published on the EHRI portal in 2019.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nDue to frontier changes after the Second World War, a number of archives relevant to Holocaust research on Germany are today located in northern and western Poland, specifically in Gorzów Wielkopolski (formerly Landsberg an der Warthe), Koszalin/Köslin, Olsztyn/Allenstein, Opole/Oppeln, Szczecin/Stettin, Wrocław/Breslau and Zielona Góra/Grünberg.",

                "history": "The German army occupied Denmark on 9 April 1940. Until 1943, the occupation regime appeared relatively benign: It dominated foreign policy, but allowed the Danish government complete autonomy in domestic affairs, including control of the legal system and police forces. The tone of the German occupation changed in early 1943. Rather than yield to German demands, the Danish government resigned on 29 August 1943. German authorities took direct control of the Danish military and police forces. Other parts of the administration still remained in Danish hands. The German occupation of Denmark ended in May 1945.\r\n\r\nBefore the Second World War, Denmark had a total population of 3.85 million people. Approximately 6,500 of them were Jews. Their community consisted mostly of some 6,000 native Danes, while the rest were refugees from Central and Eastern Europe. Most Jews lived in Copenhagen, the country's capital and largest city. Considering the relatively small Jewish population and the support most Danes gave to their fellow Jewish citizens, Germany initially followed a general policy of non-interference regarding the “Jewish question”. After the implementation of martial law in August 1943, the order for the deportation of Danish Jews reached SS General Werner Best, the German civilian administrator in Denmark, on 28 September 1943. Approximately three weeks earlier, Best himself had taken the initiative to ask Berlin if the Jews in Denmark could be arrested. However, before the arrests could be carried out, the Danish authorities, Jewish community leaders, and countless private citizens mounted a massive operation to help Jews go into hiding or into temporary sanctuaries. When German police began to round-up Jews in Denmark on the night of 1 October 1943, they had little success. The Danish resistance, assisted by many ordinary Danish citizens, organised a partly coordinated, partly spontaneous rescue operation. Within less than a month, some 8,000 refugees, mostly people who were considered Jews and their non-Jewish relatives, escaped to neutral Sweden, which accepted the Danish refugees. Meanwhile, the Germans managed to deport 472 Jews, most of whom were refugees from Germany or Eastern Europe, to the Theresienstadt ghetto. Dozens of Jews from Denmark died there before the end of the war. In late April 1945, German authorities handed the Danish prisoners over to the Swedish Red Cross. Virtually all the refugees returned to Denmark in 1945. In total, some 120 Danish Jews died during the Holocaust in Theresienstadt or during their escape from Denmark. One died in Auschwitz and one in Majdanek.\r\n\r\nDenmark has a long history of Roma presence and anti-Roma legislation. An immigration law from 1875 prohibited Roma [“Tatere”] from entering Denmark. It was not abolished until 1953. In 1934 a group of Norwegian Roma were not allowed into Denmark and as a result they were forced to travel to Belgium. This led to their deportation to Auschwitz-Birkenau. A controversial 1938 sociological and genetic study ordered by the Copenhagen welfare authorities assessed the number of Danish Roma at 700-800. During the German occupation no measures for registration or persecution of Roma were undertaken by the occupation authorities. \r\n",
                "summary": "EHRI has identified the Archives of Danish Occupation History 1940-1945 [Historisk Samling fra Besættelsestiden 1940-1945] as an important institution for Holocaust research. This institution holds archives covering the time of the German occupation of Denmark as well as from the periods immediately preceding and following the occupation. It has an almost complete collection of Danish clandestine leaflets and books from the occupation period, which makes up the main part of the archives. Furthermore, there is the National Board of Industrial Injuries [Arbejdskadestyrelsen], which contains restitution- and compensation-related materials for certain Nazi victims after the war; the Museum of Danish Resistance 1940-1945 [Frihedsmuseet]; the Danish-Jewish Museum [Dansk-jødisk museum]; the Horseroed Museum [Horserødmuseet]; and the Froeslev camp Museum [Frøslevlejrens museum]. It is also important to note that, thanks to assistance from the United State Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM), EHRI has been able to provide a number of archival unit descriptions for relevant material held by the National Archive [Rigsarkivet], including the Mosaisk Troessamfunds arkiv (MT), a restricted archive that contains lists of missing Jews.\r\n\r\nOutside of Denmark, EHRI has detected considerable Holocaust-relevant collections on Denmark at the USHMM, at Beit Terezin and, to a somewhat lesser extent, at Yad Vashem.\r\n",

                "history": "Estonia was part of the Russian Empire in 1710–1918 and it declared independence on 24 February 1918. The secret additional protocol of the 1939 Hitler-Stalin Pact assigned the country to the Soviet sphere of interest, which resulted in a military occupation by the Red Army in June 1940 and annexation as a Soviet Republic in July 1940. After the German invasion from July to October 1941, the territory of Estonia on 5 December 1941 officially became part of the civilian occupation administration of Reichskommissariat Ostland as Generalbezirk Estland. At the same time, it remained part of the operational zone of the Wehrmacht. The Red Army re-conquered the Estonian mainland in September 1944 and the islands in November 1944. Estonia’s independence was restored in August 1991.\r\n\r\nBefore the Second World War, Estonia had a total population of 1,126,413 people according to the 1934 census. Jews constituted a tiny minority of approximately 4,400 people who lived mostly in the cities of Tallinn, Tartu and Pärnu. During the Soviet occupation, about 400 Jews were deported as “unreliable or socially alien elements” to the Soviet interior. On the eve of the German occupation, some 2,000 to 2,500 Jews managed to flee from Estonia to the Soviet rear, either as part of the evacuation of industry and offices or on their own; some Jews were drafted into military service. About 1,000 Jews who remained were murdered by Einsatzgruppe A and the units subordinated to the Kommandeur der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD Estland and their local collaborators, mostly until the end of 1941. In the autumn of 1943 a network of Jewish forced labour camps was set up, mostly to exploit oil shale deposits. Up to 10,000 Jews from dismantled ghettos in Lithuania and, on occasion, from Latvia and Hungary were dispatched to these camps. Furthermore, there were transports of Jews from Germany and from the Theresienstadt /Terezín/ ghetto in the so-called Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. In the summer of 1944, a part of a transport from the Drancy camp in France was sent to camps in Estonia operated by the Security Police and SD. Male prisoners considered unfit for physical labour, as well as women and children, were usually executed upon arrival. Overall, over 7,500 of those deported to Estonia perished, mainly due to harsh labour, inhuman living conditions and targeted mass executions that accompanied the camp evacuations. Less than 1,000 Estonian Jews perished in the Holocaust, but Estonia became a killing site for thousands more Jews who had been deported from other countries.\r\n\r\nAccording to a December 1941 German census, there were 743 Roma in Estonia with a little more than half of them living in cities. Under German occupation, Roma were subject to arrest, imprisonment and summary execution and mass shootings often carried out under German order by local collaborators. Most of Estonia's Roma were murdered in Kalevi-Liiva near Tallinn. The exact number of Roma murdered is unknown. Estimates put the number of persecuted Roma between 800-1000 with only 5-6% of them surviving the war.",
                "summary": "EHRI has identified four institutions relevant to Holocaust research in Estonia, all based in the country’s capital, Tallinn. The Administration of National Archives is located in Tartu. A new main building was opened there in 2017 and many collections that were formerly held in Tallinn were transferred to repositories in Tartu. A full list is provided in the extensive report. At the National Archives of Estonia (formerly two archives, the Estonian State Archives in Tallinn and the Estonian Historical Archives in Tartu), where most collections pertaining to the Holocaust in Estonia are stored, EHRI has completed archival descriptions of over ten collections, including records on the German Security Police and SD in Estonia. Outside of Estonia, EHRI has identified several archival institutions which hold, to various degrees, collections relevant to Holocaust-research on Estonia. These include Yad Vashem, the National Archives of Latvia, State Historical Archives of Latvia, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies and Beit Terezin.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Estonia: Pre-existing research and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nEHRI identified the most important archival institutions holding Holocaust-relevant material in Estonia, relying on pre-existing academic research in the field, such as Ruth Bettina Birn: *Die Sicherheitspolizei in Estland 1941–1944. Eine Studie zur Kollaboration im Osten* (Paderborn, 2006); *Estonia 1940-1945. Reports of the Estonian International Commission for the Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity* (Tallinn, 2006); Anton Weiss-Wendt, *Murder Without Hatred: Estonians and the Holocaust* (Syracuse, 2009). EHRI also enlisted the assistance of a local specialist and, as a result, was able to identify important collections in four central archival institutions. In a second step, these collections were described, the descriptions then translated and added to the EHRI portal, where they are now accessible in English and Estonian.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Estonia’s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAn important number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created or are deposited in Estonia and can still be found in the country’s archives today. Access to them is mostly unrestricted, but records containing private or sensitive data may be withheld. For instance, personal data are protected for 30 years after a given person’s death, or, if the date of death is unknown, for 110 years after that person’s birth, or for 75 years after a given document’s creation if the dates of both birth and death are unknown. In a few cases the investigation files of the Soviet KGB or its predecessors NKGB, NKVD and others from the post-war period may be inaccessible due to both personal and sensitive data issues. That aside, researchers are allowed to take photographs from archival documents, or they can order, for a fee, digital or Xerox copies. On a practical level, a working knowledge of Estonian and/or Russian is helpful for any kind of archival research in Estonia. Most Holocaust-relevant documents, however, are in German. The local archival staff can provide help in English.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Estonia**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Estonia**\r\n\r\nHolocaust-relevant sources in Estonia are concentrated in the country’s capital, Tallinn, but divided among four archival institutions:\r\n- the National Archives of Estonia [Rahvusarhiiv]\r\n- the Estonian History Museum [Eesti Ajaloomuuseum]\r\n- the Estonian Jewish Museum [Eesti Juudi Museeum]\r\n- the Estonian Film Archives [Eesti Filmiarhiiv; now Department of the National Archives]\r\n\r\nAt the National Archives of Estonia, EHRI had identified and described a number of fonds containing a limited number of Holocaust-related records. The fonds Commander of the Security Police and SD, Estonian Security Police, Estonian SSR KGB may serve as examples of fonds that are highly important to Holocaust research on Estonia. Smaller numbers of relevant sources have been identified at the Estonian Film Archives and at the Estonian History Museum; the material stored in these institutions concerns mostly war crimes investigations. The holdings of the Estonian Jewish Museum mostly concern original materials and testimonies on Jewish life from the interwar period. Four regional departments of the National Archives, holding local documentation from the period after 1944, need to be investigated. They are, however, unlikely to hold significant quantities of Holocaust-related material.\r\n\r\nEHRI’s identification and description of these archival holdings has produced an easily accessible overview of Holocaust-relevant sources in Estonia that was previously unavailable in English.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Estonia, EHRI has identified more archival institutions holding, to various extents, collections relevant for Holocaust research. For instance, the National Archives of Latvia, State Historical Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacionālā arhīva, Latvijas Valsts vēstures arhīvs] hold the collections Wehrmacht Commander in Ostland and Commandant’s Office of the Security Police and the SD, both of which are relevant to Holocaust research on the Baltic States in general and to Estonia in particular. Furthermore, Yad Vashem, Beit Terezin and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum have collected and/or copied relevant material, e.g. on deportees to Estonia or from Estonian archives respectively.",

                "history": "In 1939, after winning the Spanish Civil War with German and Italian support against the Popular Front [Frente Popular] government, General Francisco Franco installed a dictatorship based on the ideology of the fascist Falange movement and the support of the Catholic church. During and after the Civil War, the regime was responsible for the murder of around 150,000 political opponents and the incarceration of several hundred thousands in concentration and slave labor camps. Under Franco’s rule, Spain stayed neutral throughout the Second World War, but did send volunteers, the so-called Blue Division, to fight alongside the Axis Powers against the Soviet Union. The Spanish regime was complicit in the persecution and deportation of nearly 15,000 Spanish Republican exiles from German-occupied France to concentration camps within the Reich. \r\n\r\nWhen the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, Spain had a total population of about 24.8 million people; approximately 6,000 of them were Jews. An additional 13,000 Jews lived in Spanish Morocco without Spanish citizenship. During the Civil War, many Jews left Spain, fearing the Fascists and their Axis allies. Antisemitism was an inherent part of the Franco Regime. While immigration became more complicated for the Jews, due to an antisemitic passage in the Frontier Law of 1939, approximately 20,000 to 30,000 refugees of diverse backgrounds, many Jewish, were able to leave Europe through Spain. Even though the character of the regime slowly changed during the 1950s, it maintained antisemitic legislation in certain fields (such as the medical professions). \r\n\r\nThere are no sufficient findings on the situation of Roma in Spain during the Second World War. EHRI would be pleased to receive any information. ",
                "summary": "EHRI has established that documents relevant to Holocaust research on Spain can be found at local police authorities, the archive of the General Directorate of the Police [Dirección General de la Policía], the Red Cross Archives and the Archive of the Foreign Ministry. Use of the Archive of the Ministry of the Interior appears to be restricted. Spanish provincial archives may also hold Holocaust-relevant sources: the Provincial Archives in Girona near the French border, for example, reportedly have over 8,000 Holocaust-related documents. Outside of Spain, EHRI has found a considerable number of sources pertaining to the Holocaust and Spain at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Further relevant material can also be found at the Archiv der Israelitischen Kultusgemeinde Wien and at the German Bundesarchiv in Berlin-Lichterfelde.",

                "history": "Finland was part of the Russian Empire since 1809. Having declared independence in December 1917, the country became involved in the Second World War by the Molotov-Ribbentrop Agreement of August 1939, which assigned Finland to the Soviet sphere of influence, and the resulting Soviet assault in November 1939. The ensuing “Winter War” was ended by the Finnish-Soviet Peace Treaty in March 1940 and cost Finland about ten percent of its territory, including the city of Vyborg (Viipuri). On 26 June 1941, the country joined Hitler’s war against the USSR to recoup the losses incurred the year before. After achieving its objectives, Finland did not wish to join in Nazi Germany's wider war aims and did not, for instance, participate in the German attack on Leningrad. However, Finland rejected a Soviet peace offer made in April 1944 and it was the Red Army’s offensive two months later which forced Finland to sign an armistice in September 1944. After this, Finnish troops forced the German military in the country to withdraw to still-occupied Norway. Finland formally declared war on Germany in March 1945.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War, Finland had a total population of approximately 3,695,000 inhabitants. There were about 2,000 Jews among them, most of them Finnish citizens. In addition, a few hundred foreign-born Jews had been admitted to the country as refugees in the 1930s. Between 1941 and 1944, the treatment of Jews in Finland depended to a large degree on their legal status: Finnish Jews had the same rights and obligations as their fellow citizens. Foreign Jews, on the other hand, were subjected to police surveillance and threatened with deportation even for minor infractions. Twelve Jewish refugees were handed over to the German authorities by the Finnish Ministry for Internal Affairs and the Security Police. More than 700 Jews were most at risk, as they were part of the 60,000 Soviet prisoners-of-war in Finnish captivity. As a result of Finnish-German Security Police co-operation, the Finnish Security Police and military authorities handed over 521 “undesirable” Soviet prisoners-of-war, including more than 50 Soviet Jews, to the German Security Police for execution. The Germans showed no acute interest, however, in the remaining Jews in Finnish custody. When Finland began to disentangle itself from the war in 1943, the country gradually relaxed its policy towards foreigners and prisoners-of-war. “Undesirable” prisoners were no longer handed over to the Germans and a settlement with the Swedish government was negotiated, providing for the transfer of Jewish refugees to Sweden.\r\n\r\nFinland's Roma population was estimated to be around 4,000 people in 1939. While no Finnish Roma were handed over to the Germans, the Roma community faced discrimination and hostility. The 1,500 Karelian Roma who had to leave after the \"Winter War\" between Finland and the Soviet Union 1939/1940 were not allowed to return between 1941 and 1944, unlike the rest of the Karelian population. Attempts to implement plans by the Finnish state to put all Roma in labour camps were unsuccessful. Some 300 Roma fought in the Finnish army which has contributed to a positive memory of the Second World War and a heightened sense of equality and community with the wider Finnish society. This has been encouraged by both Finland's Roma community and the Finnish state.",
                "summary": "EHRI explored the Finnish archives for Holocaust-relevant material by building upon existing research and a growing scholarly interest in the history of Finland during the Holocaust, which used to be accessible only with adequate language skills. Archival guides on Holocaust-related material in Finland were available only in Finnish. Research institutions outside of Finland, such as the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, however, do provide a selection of copied Holocaust-relevant sources on Finland and may have reference works in languages other than Finnish.\r\n\r\nTwo major relevant archival institutions, as well as their key collections on the Holocaust, have been identified: the National Archives [Kansallisarkisto] with their seven provincial branches and the Archives of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs [Ulkoasiainministeriön arkisto]. Between them, the two institutions hold eight Holocaust-relevant fonds. For a more detailed description, see the extensive report. Within the National Archives, EHRI has translated the catalogue of the Finnish Jewish Archives into English, and entered it into the local database Vakka. For details, see the extensive report. Furthermore, EHRI has assembled information on sources regarding the country’s involvement in the Holocaust that has been made available by collecting institutions outside of Finland, such as the USHMM, NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies and Yad Vashem.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Finland: Pre-existing research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nIn Finland, EHRI’s exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources was able to rely on some important pre-existing research in the field, such as Hannu Rautkallio’s *Finland and the Holocaust* (1987) or Oula Silvennnoinen’s *Geheime Waffenbrüderschaft. Die sicherheitspolizeiliche Zusammenarbeit zwischen Deutschland und Finnland* (2010), which had already made extensive use of archival sources kept both in Finland and a number of other countries. Furthermore, during EHRI’s first phase, its Finnish consortium partner, the National Archives of Finland, translated and coordinated the survey and data descriptions of Holocaust-related sources for the project. As a result, important collections in two Helsinki-based central archives were identified, and some additional material in Finnish provincial archives was discovered. These collections were described, the descriptions then translated and added to the EHRI portal, where they are now accessible in Finnish and English.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Finland’s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nA considerable number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created in Finland and can still be found in the country’s archives today. File dispersal is minimal, thanks to negligible wartime destruction of archival material and to the concentration of the country’s archival institutions in Helsinki. Access to archival sources is unrestricted, with the exception of personal data which, according to § 28 of the Population Information Act 661/2009, can only be accessed 50 years after a person’s death or, if the year of death is unknown, 100 years after that person’s birth. A working knowledge of Finnish is necessary for any kind of archival research in Finland, even though documents in other languages (sometimes English, French, German, but mostly Russian and Swedish) can also be found with the help of the local archival staff.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Finland**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Finland**\r\n\r\nIn Finland, EHRI has identified two archival institutions which hold Holocaust-relevant collections. Both are located in Helsinki:\r\n- the National Archives [Kansallisarkisto], and\r\n- the Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [Ulkoasiainministeriön arkisto]\r\n\r\nAt these two archives alone, eight Holocaust-related fonds have been identified and described in both Finnish and English. The large Finnish Jewish Archives (an important part of which consists of the Helsinki Jewish community archives) is held by the National Archives. The catalogue of the Finnish Jewish Archives was translated into English for EHRI, and entered both into the local database Vakka and into the EHRI portal. It was possible to integrate the data of this large fonds using OAI-PMH or “harvesting” (i.e. Open Archives Initiative – Protocol for Metadata Harvesting), so all levels of the description (including child items) are included.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions for the other seven fonds were done manually. As such, the National Archives also have descriptions for the large Archive of the Finnish Red Cross, and personal files compiled by the Finnish State Police (VALPO) on Finns and foreigners who were considered politically suspicious. The Holocaust-relevant sources preserved at the Archives of the Foreign Ministry, on the other hand, fit in a small number of boxes and single files, but are important nonetheless. They contain information on the “Jewish question” and Jewish refugees, but also on the war crimes investigation against the head of the Finnish State Police, Arno Anthoni. EHRI has yet to include the archives of the Finnish Ministry of Defence, which have partly been surveyed by the USHMM. Outside the Helsinki-based central archives, the Turku branch of the provincial archives holds the Archives of the Jewish Community of Turku. Six more Finnish provincial archives remain to be surveyed for Holocaust-relevant material.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nEHRI’s identification and description work on Finland was important as there are no third parties known to have carried out systematic surveys so far. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has microfilmed a limited number of sources from the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and from the Finnish Ministry of Defence records. European archival institutions, such as NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam, hold further Holocaust-relevant material on Finland as does the German Bundesarchiv.",

                "history": "France was invaded by the German army in May 1940, fell in June, and signed an armistice a few weeks later. General de Gaulle, established a government-in-exile in London, Free France, which joined the Allies and supported the Resistance. According to the armistice, Germany de facto annexed the regions of Alsace and Lorraine, while the rest of France was principally divided into a small demilitarized Italian zone in the south east and two large parts: the Occupied Zone and the Free Zone. The first encapsulated Northern France and the Atlantic Coast and was placed under German military control. Southern France remained unoccupied and was placed under the control of a new French government, headed by Marshal Philippe Pétain. In response to the Allied landings in North Africa in November 1942, German and Italian forces also occupied the Southern Zone. When Italy attempted to surrender to the Allies in September 1943, the Germans took over the Italian zone of France. The liberation of France began with the Allied landings in Normandy on 6 June 1944. Two months later, on 25 August, the German forces in Paris surrendered.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1940, France had a total population of 40,690,000 inhabitants. Some 300,000 to 350,000 were Jewish, with 145,000 living in the Southern Zone. About half of the Jewish population were not French citizens, but Jews who had moved to France after the First World War or had arrived as Jewish refugees during the 1930s. Almost immediately after the occupation, Jews in both zones were subjected to a first wave of anti-Jewish measures. In the German-controlled zone, Jews were removed from their jobs, their freedom of movement was restricted, and many were arrested. At the same time, the Vichy government actively commenced persecuting Jews. In October 1940, it passed a set of anti-Jewish laws called the Statut des Juifs [Jewish Statute]. In March 1941, the Vichy authorities set up a General Commissariat for Jewish Affairs [Commissariat Général aux Questions Juives]. In June 1942, the Germans forced the Jews in the occupied zone to wear the Jewish badge for easy identification, began arresting large groups, and restricted the movements of the remaining community. The “round-ups” [“rafles”] were carried out by the French police in summer 1942. The most notable was the roundup of the Vélodrôme d'Hiver or Vél d’Hiv in Paris. There, about 13,000 Jews (men, women and children) were rounded up, and some 7,000 of them were jammed into the Vél d’Hiv in deplorable conditions. Many thousands of Jews were arrested and sent to transit camps, mostly to Drancy, Compiègne and Pithiviers, from where they were deported to Nazi-occupied Poland. The Vichy authorities also arrested and deported approximately 7,000 Jews from their zone in the summer of 1942. Altogether, 42,500 Jews were sent to Nazi-occupied Poland during 1942. Nearly one third of them came from unoccupied France. German authorities resumed transports of Jews from France in January 1943 and continued the deportations until August 1944. In total, approximately 80,000 Jews were deported from France. Some 70,000 were sent to Auschwitz, while the others were sent to Majdanek, Sobibor and, in smaller numbers, to Buchenwald. Among the deportees, only 2,000 survived. Others died in detention on French soil.\r\n\r\nIn 1939, it is estimated that there were around 40,000 \"nomades\" (e.g. Sinti/Manouches, Roma, Gitans, Yenish) living in France. Already on 6 April 1940, before the German occupation of France, the government ordered the arrest of \"nomades\" in camps. Others were put under house arrest. Discrimination and restrictions on freedom of movement intensified under German occupation. More than 30 detention camps existed during the Second World War in both the occupied and free zones of France, with approximately 6,500 Sinti and Roma interned. A lot of inmates tried to flee; a significant number of Sinti and Roma fought in the resistance movement. Some were deported to Germany and did not survive. Some of the detention camps existed until May 1946, when the government repealed the decree.\r\n\r\nNote: The former French colonies are discussed in country reports under their present-day name.",
                "summary": "EHRI has merged and updated the existing information about public and private archives in France which hold Holocaust-related materials. The EHRI portal displays the National Archives [Archives nationales de France], the Departmental Archives [Archives départementales], the archives of the Ministries of Defence, Justice, Foreign Affairs, and several Jewish archives and institutions.\r\n\r\nOne of the, if not the, most important Holocaust-relevant archives in France is the Mémorial de la Shoah in Paris. The archive and documentation centre of the Mémorial, the former Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine [CDJC, Centre of Contemporary Jewish Documentation[, holds more than 30 million archival documents, including many originals bearing the signatures of the heads of the Third Reich and those responsible for the deportation of the Jews from France. Since 24 December 2015, the French government opened access to the judicial archives concerning the Vichy regime, collaborationists and the purge during the liberation of France. These historical documents are contained in the Mémorial’s collections and they can be consulted in the reading room of the Documentation Centre. An archival catalogue is available online (not including data relating to the privacy of individuals mentioned).\r\n\r\nEqually important are the National Archives, which hold administrative records created by several ministries and other central public bodies during the Vichy regime; Vichy and post-war legal proceedings; and documents donated by survivors. At a more local level, the Departmental Archives are highly relevant for study of racial laws and their implementation. It is also worth mentioning the National Archives branch for France’s overseas colonies [Archives Nationales d'Outre-mer], where the unique “Préfecture de Constantine. Service des questions juives et des sociétés secrètes” collection can be found. Finally, the National Audiovisual Institute [INA, Institut National de l’Audiovisuel] holds Holocaust-related audiovisual material.\r\n\r\nOther important Holocaust-relevant archival institutions in France include the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, the Fondation pour la Mémoire de la Déportation, the ORT-archives, the “Contemporaine” Library (former Bibliothèque de Documentation Internationale Contemporaine which holds the archives of the Cimade), the Fédération Nationale des Déportés et Internés Résistants et Patriotes, Maison de la culture yiddish – Bibliothèque Medem, and the Alliance Israélite Universelle.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to France: Pre-existing research (and third-party surveys), available archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nFor its identification and investigation work, EHRI was able to rely on its consortium partner Mémorial de la Shoah.\r\n\r\nTwo helpful research tools were identified:\r\n- Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine, *Guide européen des sources d'archives sur la Shoah* [European guide of archival sources on the Shoah], Paris, 1999, Vol.1, 194p. that covers Holocaust-related archives in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States\r\n- The French project [Territoire et Trajectoire de la Déportation](http://tetrade.huma-num.fr/Tetrademap_Enfant_France/) provides geo-mapping on the deportation of Jews from France. The project currently presents two maps: the ‘Cartographie des enfants juifs de Paris déportés de juillet 1942 à août 1944’ [Map of Jewish children deported from Paris between July 1942 and August 1944] and the same map covering the whole of France.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of France’s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe central organisation for the conservation and consultation of public archives are the National Archives of France [Archives nationales de France]. They consist of three services at a national level. The first, general one, includes the agency locations in Paris, Fontainebleau and Pierrefitte-sur-Seine. The two others are specialised and decentralised: the National Overseas Archives [Archives nationales d’Outre-Mer] in Aix-en-Provence which include material on the former French colonies, and the National Labour Archives [Archives nationales du monde du travail] in Roubaix. Territorial and municipal archives conserve their own records, as specified in the Heritage Act (articles L. 212-6 and L. 212-6-1). Municipalities with less than 2,000 inhabitants are required to transfer their archives to the Departmental Archives [Archives départementales], unless the prefect decides otherwise. France has 101 Departmental Archives.\r\n\r\nSome organisations are allowed to preserve their own archives, and treat them according to the rules that apply for public archives. The most important ones are the Ministry of Defence [Ministère de la Défense], the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [Ministère des Affaires Etrangères], and the Paris Police Headquarters [Préfecture de Police de Paris]. Access to public archives is regulated by the Heritage Act [Code du Patrimoine, plus changes in law 2008-696 of 15 July 2008]. Certain files only become accessible after a period varying between 25 and 100 years after the date on the document.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on France**\r\n\r\n**C. I. In France**\r\n\r\nEHRI has merged and updated the existing information about archives holding Holocaust-relevant materials in France. The portal currently contains over 120 repository descriptions, including the National Archives, the Departmental Archives), the archives of the Ministries of Defence, Justice, Foreign Affairs, and several Jewish archives and institutions.\r\n\r\nOne of the , if not the, most important archive on the subject in France, is the Mémorial de la Shoah in Paris. The archive and documentation centre of the Mémorial, the former Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine [CDJC, Centre of Contemporary Jewish Documentation], hold more than 30 million archival documents, including many originals bearing the signature of the heads of the Third Reich and of those responsible for the deportation of the Jews from France. These historical documents are contained in the archive collections listed below, which can be consulted in the reading room of the Documentation Centre. An archival catalogue is available online (not including data relating to the privacy of individuals mentioned). The Mémorial’s collections include German, French and other source collections.\r\n\r\nThe German sources include records from the Headquarters of the Militärbefehlshaber in Frankreich (MBF). The MBF, or German military administration in France, is divided into two major sections:\r\n1. Archives of the military command, which cover the collaboration between the occupation authorities and the Pétain government in general, the persecution of the Jews and the general reprisal policy;\r\n2. Archives of the administrative command, which include the documents dealing with the control of the occupation authorities over the French economy (interference, spoliations, in particular economic aryanisation). More specifically:\r\n  - The German Embassy in Paris, which was very actively involved in the anti-Jewish measures as can be attested by the numerous telegrams and letters sent several times per day to Berlin by Abetz and Schleier (Plenipotentiary Minister at the German embassy in Paris),\r\n  - The Gestapo in occupied France: the most important group of archives analysed is made up of the records of the Anti-Jewish division of the Gestapo in Paris. This group includes letters, telegrams, and reports on internments, deportations and other measures taken against the Jews, such as wearing the yellow star, rescinding naturalisations as well as general reprisals. There are also documents showing the pressure exerted on Italian policy in their occupied zone. This group also contains documents on the Gestapo in France preserved in the German federal archives [Bundesarchiv Koblenz]. These records give us a true picture of the structures and the activity of the Gestapo in France and in particular in the anti-Jewish division, first led by Dannecker then Rothke.\r\n\r\nThe “Archives of the Nuremberg Trials” contain part of the documentation collected for the investigations of the international military trial as well as the trials conducted by the American military court. For this major group of archives, a specific classification system is used. The main subdivisions are as follows:\r\n- NO (Nazi Organisation): this reference includes the documents from any Nazi organisation, in particular on the role of the S.S., and the WVHA (Central Office of the Economy and the Administration of the S.S.)\r\n- NOKW (Nazi \"Oberkommando der Wehrmacht\"): documents concerning the activities of the German army\r\n- NG (Nazi Government): documents illustrating the activity of the State bodies related to those of the Party\r\n- NI (Nazi Industry): documents related to industry and the financial institutions of the Third Reich\r\n\r\nThe French source collections at the Mémorial include:\r\n- The archives of the General Commissariat for Jewish Questions, or Archives du Commissariat Général aux Questions Juives (CGQJ), with more than 20,000 documents, including the trial proceedings against its leaders\r\n- The archives of Professor Montandon, an ethnologist and \"expert on racial issues\" with the CGQJ. This piecemeal collection covers the period 1924 to 1944 and primarily concerns his ethnological scientific work and his anti-Jewish propaganda activities from 1938 onwards\r\n- The archives of the Institut d'Étude des Questions Juives, a body created in 1941 under the instigation of Dannecker and of which the Mémorial holds the major portion of the surviving documents. The collection includes the correspondence of the Secretary General and describes all the activities of the Institute\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the archives of the Mémorial contain many other documents, including the Service of the Armistice, the Prefecture of the Police as well as Jewish organisations such as: l'Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants (O.S.E.); les Eclaireurs Israélites de France (E.I.F.); la Fédération des Sociétés Juives de France (F.S.J.F.); Le Conseil Représentatif des Institutions Juives de France (C.R.I.F.); l'Oeuvre de Protection de L'Enfance Juive (O.P.E.J.); and la Commission Centrale de l'Enfance (C.C.E.). Furthermore, many private collections have been donated to the Mémorial.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the EHRI project, Mémorial de la Shoah was changing its database system. Therefore data integration was not possible in the early stage of the project. Moreover, the descriptive system of the Mémorial was two-fold: a very general description of its holdings on its website and an item description for internal use. Neither of these met EHRI's specifications of top-level collection descriptions. Therefore, Mémorial de la Shoah started by describing the heart of its collections in French and English. All the available metadata have now been integrated into the EHRI portal.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Mémorial de la Shoah’s collections, EHRI provides descriptions for material at several other archival institutions in France. Namely, the National Archives, which hold administrative records created by several ministries and other central public bodies during the Vichy regime; Vichy and post-war legal proceedings; and documents donated by survivors. The material related to the General Commission on Jewish Affairs [Commissariat général aux questions juives] is particularly significant. EHRI has also described the closely-related ‘Archives of the Institute for the Study of Jewish Questions’ [Archives de l’Institut d’étude des question juives], which are held by the Defence Historical Service [Service historique de la Défense]. Moreover, EHRI provides descriptions for material at the National Archives branch for France’s overseas colonies and the National Audiovisual Institute, which possesses Holocaust-related audiovisual material. Finally, EHRI also provides links from departmental archival institutions to several United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) archival descriptions, which are available as copies at the USHMM.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nThe USHMM holds many copies of many different French archival institutions; Furthermore, the NARA (National Archives and Records Administration) in Maryland/USA possesses all the archives of the U.S. embassy in France from 1936–1941 and 1944–1953 under “Records of the Foreign Service Posts of the Department of State.” In Germany, Bundesarchiv holds a number of relevant collections, as does the Politisches Archiv des Auswärtigen Amts and the Institut für Zeitgeschichte. In Israel and Russia, Yad Vashem and the RGVA hold records and copies from various organisations and offices in France.",

                "history": "The United Kingdom declared war on Nazi Germany on 3 September 1939, after the German invasion of Poland. After the defeat of France in the spring of 1940, the British Expeditionary Force withdrew from the European Continent. Although the Channel Islands near the French coast did fall into German hands, from the summer of 1940 until 1945, mainland Britain resisted German invasion and became a refuge for many governments-in-exile and refugees of the occupied countries in Europe.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the war, 370,000 to 390,000 Jews were living in the UK, out of a total population of about 48 million. The Channel Islands were home to only a few dozen Jews. Anti-Jewish measures on the Islands were issued by the German military authorities in Paris and followed the timing of those in France. They were implemented by the German military administration with the assistance of local authorities. In both Guernsey and Jersey, antisemitic legislation was passed by the Royal Court. About ten Jews were deported. The Nazis operated a number of concentration and forced labour camps on the island of Alderney from January 1942 with approximately 5,000, mostly Eastern European inmates. About 890 of the prisoners were French Jewish forced labourers, at least 8 of whom died there. The United Kingdom had begun accepting refugees following the November Pogrom of 1938 when the British Government agreed to allow an unrestricted number of unaccompanied Jewish children to enter the country, a measure which remained in effect until the war broke out in September 1939. In total, approximately 65,000 Jewish refugees found shelter in the UK. British forces liberated concentration camps in northern Germany, including Neuengamme and Bergen-Belsen. \r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, there were an estimated 45,000 Roma in England, which was the majority of Roma in the United Kingdom. Despite existing prejudices, Roma contributed to the war effort against Nazi Germany in manifold ways. The UK was an important country for gathering information on what was happening to Roma in German-occupied and -dominated Europe during and after the Second World War. ",
                "summary": "EHRI has merged and updated the existing information about archives holding Holocaust-relevant materials in the UK. The portal contains over twenty repositories holding Holocaust-related materials in the UK, including The National Archives, the Island Archives in Guernsey, the Jersey Archives and the Imperial War Museums in London. The Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum as well as the Polish Underground Movement Study Trust hold important Holocaust-related material generated by the Polish government-in-exile as well as the Polish underground in occupied Poland. The Wiener Holocaust Library is the oldest Holocaust memorial institution in the world. Founded as the Jewish Central Information Office in 1933 by Dr Alfred Wiener, the Library has been based in London since 1939, and holds extensive collections including published and unpublished works, eyewitness accounts, photographs and press cuttings. An important task of the EHRI project in the UK was to include information about the collections held by the Wiener Library in the EHRI Portal. Most of the Wiener Library collections have descriptions written by a member of the Wiener Library archive staff. These collection descriptions are included in the Archives Hub and the export of these descriptions from this Archives Hub to the EHRI Portal has been completed.",
                "extensive": "Disclaimer: The EHRI Extensive Report was updated in 2024.\r\n\r\n**A. EHRI approach to the United Kingdom: Pre-existing research, archival guides, and expert support**\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom, EHRI has identified, with the support of EHRI partner Wiener Library, a number of online research tools and traditional archival guides:\r\n\r\n- [AIM25](http://www.aim25.ac.uk/)\r\n\r\nAIM25 is a major project that provides electronic access to collection level descriptions of archives from over one hundred higher education institutions, learned societies, cultural organisations and City livery companies within the greater London area. This work is in progress – new data is being added regularly. EHRI partner Wiener Library is participating in this project.\r\n\r\n- [The Archives Hub](http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/)\r\n\r\nThe Archives Hub is a service funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee. It provides access to descriptions of archival collections held across the UK. At present it covers the descriptions of approximately 200 collection holding institutions. EHRI partner Wiener Library is participating in this project.\r\n\r\n- [Yerusha Portal](https://yerusha.eu/)\r\n\r\nThe Yerusha portal, which incorporates Jewish-related archives around the world and ingests some of the WL’s collections, as well as Southampton, LmA, etc. might be useful to include. Aggregates Jewish archives, not solely focused on the Holocaust\r\n\r\nAmong the traditional archival guides, the following should be mentioned:\r\n- [2000] Wilkinson, Mary & Julie Robertshaw, *Select catalogue of English-language material on the Holocaust held in the department of printed books* (London: Imperial War Museum, Department of Printed Books, 2000),\r\n- [1993] Cantwell, John D., *The Second World War. A guide to documents in the Public Record Office* (London: HMSO, 1993).\r\n\r\nAn important task of the EHRI project in the UK was to include information about the collections held by the Wiener Holocaust Library in the EHRI Portal. Most of the Wiener Holocaust Library collections have descriptions written by the library’s staff. These collection descriptions are included in the Archives Hub mentioned above and have been exported from here to the EHRI Portal.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the British archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe National Archives in London are the official archives for the UK Government, storing its records and those of the United Kingdom’s central courts. The Public Records Act (1958) places responsibility for the management of public records on departments. Additional repositories of The National Archives also exist on the Channel Islands, Jersey and Guernsey. In addition to The National archives, there are many private archive initiatives.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on the United Kingdom**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In the United Kingdom**\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom, EHRI has identified over 20 repositories, and is able to provide over hundreds of archival descriptions from several institutions. The Wiener Holocaust Library is the oldest Holocaust memorial institution in the world. Founded as the Jewish Central Information Office in 1933 by Dr Alfred Wiener, the Library has been based in London since 1939 and holds extensive collections including published and unpublished works, eyewitness accounts, photographs and press cuttings.\r\n\r\nHolocaust-related material, however, is held by many other archival institutions, such as the Island Archives in Guernsey, which hold extensive collections on the German occupation of Guernsey (1940-1945), including those of the Feldkommandantur and the local civil administration, or Jersey Archives, which stores registration cards and significant records of all aspects from the German occupation. In The National Archives, there are very important documents relating to the Second World War and the Holocaust among the British government and military records. The most popular are within departments War Office (WO), Home Office (HO), Prime Minister’s Office Records (PREM) and Foreign Office (FO). The National Archives also holds records of war crimes and criminals (both alleged and proved) from 1939–1945 as well as copies of documents captured by the Western Allied forces from enemy powers at the end of the Second World War. Furthermore, the Imperial War Museum in London has collections ranging from film and oral history to works of art and large objects, but also to personal letters and diaries. The Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum as well as the Polish Underground Movement Study Trust hold important Holocaust-related material generated by the Polish government-in-exile as well as the Polish underground in occupied Poland. The collections in the Sikorski Institute are now regarded as holding the most important Polish émigré collections in the world. An extensive description of the Institute and its holdings can be found in Alina Skibińska’s archival guide, which has been revised and translated into English as part of EHRI’s efforts to make Holocaust-relevant sources linked to Poland easier to locate.\r\n\r\nFinally, archives in the UK also house many sources about the Holocaust in other countries, mainly concerning British intelligence on what was happening in occupied Europe as well as the reactions of the governments-in-exile and resistance movements located in the UK.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of the United Kingdom, the United State Memorial Museum, Yad Vashem hold collections that are relevant to Holocaust research on the United Kingdom.",

                "history": "Greece was attacked by Italy in late October 1940. In April 1941, the country was also invaded by German troops. With the Greek army defeated, the country remained under enemy occupation until October 1944. Greece was divided into three zones. Germany controlled parts of Greek Macedonia (including Thessaloniki), Thrace, Piraeus, and Crete. Bulgaria annexed Eastern Greek Macedonia and the rest of Thrace. Athens was jointly occupied by Germany and Italy. After Italy’s surrender in September 1943, all Italian-occupied regions came under German rule. The Red Army’s advance in late 1944 forced the Germans to withdraw from Greece. In October 1944, British troops entered Athens unopposed.\r\n\r\nIn 1941, Greece had a total population of approximately 7,370,000 inhabitants, up to 80,000 of whom were Jews. While there were Jewish communities in at least two dozen cities, the biggest one was in Thessaloniki, which totalled some 55,000 people. On 11 July 1942, all male Jews between 18 and 45 years old were gathered in one of the city’s squares and beaten and humiliated for hours. After their registration, thousands of them were subjected to forced labour. Three months later, after the payment of a huge ransom, they were released. In February 1943, the Jews were obliged to wear the Yellow Star and forced to move into two ghetto areas. Between March and August of that year, up to 46,000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where most of them were murdered upon arrival. In the Italian zone, the Jews lived in relative safety until the Italian surrender to the Allies in September 1943. After the Germans took control of the Italian zone, almost all its Jews were also deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. The Jews from the territories under Bulgarian administration were deported to Treblinka in March 1943 following a Bulgarian-German agreement signed a month earlier. In total, less than twenty percent of the Greek Jews survived the Holocaust, with the highest percentage of victims from Thessaloniki and the Bulgarian occupation zone.\r\n\r\nFor this country there are no sufficient findings on the history of Roma during the Second World War. EHRI would be pleased to receive any information.",
                "summary": "In Greece, EHRI has identified over 40 Holocaust-relevant repositories and has provided more than 90 archival descriptions for collections within these archives. Apart from the GSA, central and regional services, materials about Greek Jewry before and during the Second World War can be found in the Service of Diplomatic and Historical Archives of the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs [Ypiresia Diplomatikou kai Istorikou Arheiou, YDIA] in Athens. Important collections on the Holocaust in Greece can also be found in archives in Thessaloniki and Athens, which were home to the two central Jewish communities before and after the Second World War. The important Records of the Central Agency for the Custody of Jewish Property (Archeio tis Ypiresias Diacheirisis Israilitikon Periousion, YDIP), which regulated the expropriation of Jewish businesses in Greece during the war, are kept in the Archives of the Jewish Museum of Greece in Athens. The Jewish Community of Thessaloniki (General Communal Archives) holds the declarations of finances and property completed by its members prior to their deportation to Auschwitz in 1943. A collection of correspondence between different Greek Jewish communities and Greek authorities concerning the restitution of property is held in the Archive of the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece in Athens.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Greece: Pre-existing research, third-party surveys, available archival guides, and expert support**\r\n\r\nWhen EHRI began its work, a number of studies on the Holocaust in Greece were available, such as Hagen Fleischer’s *Crown and Swastika: Greece during the Occupation and the Resistance, 1941-1944* (1995) and Steven Bowman’s *The Agony of Greek Jews* (2009). Other important works on the subject include a number of publications which are available only in Greek:\r\n\r\n- [2012] Varon-Vassard, Odette, *I Analysi Mias Dyskolis Mnimis.

This series is co-published by EHRI-partner Institute for Contemporary History Munich-Berlin [Institut für Zeitgeschichte München-Berlin, IfZ]. A translation of the series into English under the title *The Persecution and Murder of European Jews by Nazi Germany, 1933–1945* is under preparation with the cooperation of Yad Vashem.\r\n\r\nThe GSA has an online catalogue, Arxeiomnimon (2013): http://arxeiomnimon.gak.gr/. Containing some seven million pages of documents it allows navigation through parts of the archival collections originating from 37 GSA agencies (the central service and 36 branches). It should be noted that while the metadata fields are provided in English, the actual descriptions are in Greek. Furthermore, those agencies and materials not included in Arxeiomnimon as of yet are either uncatalogued, or published in Greek-language finding aids or index cards stored in the reading rooms of the respective branches. These published finding aids and index cards, however, are less standardized than the online database.\r\n\r\nThe Hellenic Literary and Historical Archive, better known as E.L.I.A. (part of the National Bank of Greece Cultural Foundation, M.I.E.T.) also has an extensive online Greek language catalogue which meets international metadata standards: http://www.elia.org.gr/ \r\n\r\nAnother useful online resource is the [Database of Greek-Jewish Holocaust Survivors’ Testimonies](http://gjst.ha.uth.gr/en/theproject.php), which has built up a vast collection of audio and visual testimonies from Greek Jews who survived the Holocaust. The database is a virtual archive that systematically brings together testimonies from repositories in Greece and abroad, public and private collections, collected in different languages and places, at different times. \r\nEHRI started its identification and investigation work for data integration on Greece from researcher interviews carried out by the “user requirements” for the project. By linking data integration and user requirements, EHRI aims to ensure that the EHRI Portal will attract historians, archivists, and the general public, and that it identifies the data that researchers hope to find on the EHRI Portal, in order to generate more interest and offer more meaningful content and format. Researchers of the Holocaust in Greece interviewed by EHRI were asked to suggest further researchers specialized in Holocaust history in Greece to participate in an EHRI workshop on data integration and Holocaust research in Greece, which took place in December 2012. Four representatives of archival institutions in Greece, three graduate students, two junior and two senior researchers participated in the workshop.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the workshop was to receive expert feedback on this list and further complete EHRI’s overview of the archival institutions and identify Holocaust-related collections within the institutions. EHRI also needed to better understand the format of the metadata and detect where further surveying was necessary. The overall goal was to create a state-of-the-art report of identified Holocaust-related sources in Greece and to add this information to the EHRI portal, as much as possible via the technical Work Packages (as opposed to manually entering the information into the portal).\r\n\r\nThe Greek workshop has had multiple benefits for EHRI as it has helped ensure that the content fits the user. It was a time-efficient identification method which avoided duplication of work. At the same time, it was an investment in smooth communication with future Portal users. We found that the EHRI Portal can support Holocaust-research in Greece by improving access to information about the materials, be it awareness about and location of repositories or identifying relevant collections within repositories. Engaging with the research community can help EHRI further enrich the data by annotating and adding it to the portal. A second important role for EHRI can be to reach out to the institutions and offer them tools and a platform to share the information about their holdings to the research community.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Greek archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nA major challenge in Greece is that there are an unknown number of materials which remain largely invisible. As a consequence, there is no indication about their existence online and there is a huge (digital) description backlog, which requires thorough identifying and inventorying. As a consequence, uncatalogued materials remain hidden.\r\n\r\nFinding aids are often only consultable at the repository itself. The limited amount of online information and locally available cataloguing systems make access to the physical materials time consuming, often costly, and inefficient (a research trip is hard to prepare).\r\n\r\nAnother challenge concerns receiving permission for consultation. Access to public archives in Greece often requires an application procedure before any access is granted. Two laws regulate the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal and sensitive archives (1991 and 1997). The time limit for keeping records restricted was reduced from fifty to thirty years (although there is room for flexibility in certain cases). In some cases it is not possible or there are limits to taking photographs as well as making scans or photocopies. Sometimes, a reading room’s lack of capacity can be an issue.\r\n\r\nAt the Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, not all archives can be made publicly accessible for reasons of national security, among others. Moreover, there has been at least one case where a collection of documents concerning the Holocaust was removed from the original collections and was put in one separate collection, leading to a loss of context.\r\n\r\nAnother issue pertains to the destruction of archives. The destruction of archives does not only apply to Holocaust archives, but has included sources Holocaust-related sources. For example, the archives of the Greek Agency for War Crimes, which was founded in the autumn of 1945, were totally destroyed in 1975. In some cases, materials have been scanned before destruction. The Jewish Community of Thessaloniki, which engages in such digitization projects, has preserved certain sources in this way. \r\n\r\nYet another challenge is that material is in the possession of private organisations which do not necessarily consider themselves archival institutions. These archives are hard to locate and often remain “hidden treasures”. Being able to share the knowledge on the mere existence of these hidden treasures by entering or annotating them to the EHRI portal could already be a major step forward for Greek Holocaust research, especially at the local level, in Jewish community archives.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Greece**\r\n\r\nIn Greece, EHRI identified 43 Holocaust-relevant repositories, and was able to present 96 archival descriptions by December 2018. While many archival institutions can be found, predictably, in the country’s capital, Athens, important collections are also held by regional branches of the General State Archives (GSA), especially in Greece’s northern regions, i.e. in Central Macedonia, as well as in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace.\r\n\r\nThe largest institution for EHRI’s purposes in Greece, the General State Archives (National Archives of Greece, GSA), are the national institution responsible for the preservation and promotion of the Greek archival materials. The institution was created in 1914 and its operation is organized by law. The Greek State Archives consist of a central service, 47 regional services and 16 local archives. Based on the location of the wartime Jewish communities in Greece – in at least 27 cities according to the Central Board of Jewish Communities of Greece (2009) – researchers will have to visit different GSA branches if they wish to consult archives relating to particular communities. It is also important to keep in mind that a large amount of the material in the GSA remains non-digital and not all the digitized materials have been included in Arxeiomnimon yet.\r\n\r\nIn March 2008, all branches of the GSA were asked to provide an overview of collections and documents related to the history of the Jews in Greece and the Holocaust in order to prepare the survey work of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM). The responses were rather limited: fifteen to twenty local offices submitted such a report, which varied from a short note confirming there is such material available to an overview of records. These overviews have served as orientation tools for EHRI’s work in Greece. \r\n\r\nBeyond the GSA’s collections, the Jewish Museum of Greece (JMG) conserves more than 2,000 artefacts, including books and pamphlets, periodicals, maps, documents, manuscripts (personal notes, correspondence, memoires, diaries, etc.), false IDs, personal objects, ritual objects, jewellery, textiles and costumes, clothing, badges, armbands, numismatics (coins, banknotes, stock certificates) and an art collection. The JMG’s Holocaust archive includes records of the Central Agency for the Custody of Jewish Property (the Ypiresias Diacheirisis Israilitikon Periousion, Y.D.I.P. archive), the Ο.Π.Α.Ι.Ε archive (O.P.A.I.E., the Heirless Property and Jewish Rehabilitation Fund), private and personal archives which include material pertinent to the Shoah, the JMG Archive of Oral Testimonies and a Photographic Archive. The JMG’s Holocaust Photographic Archive has a rich and expanding collection of photographic images spanning from the pre-war period to the early 1950s. The broad subject areas, each including several subcategories, capture Jewish life before, during and after the Second World War and the Holocaust. An extensive number of document scans and photographs of the museum’s collection have been uploaded in Judaica Europeana.\r\n\r\nWhile EHRI has identified a considerable number of archives and institutions with Holocaust-relevant collections, many others are yet to be located. For example, the location of the Police and Army Archives remains unknown. The same goes for sources relating to two concentration camps in Greece where Jews were imprisoned. Archival documentation on their presence is missing. In other cases, EHRI is aware of the existence of archives that are likely to hold Holocaust-related materials, but is yet to ascertain the significance of their collections. Archives and institutions that fall under this category include: the Chamber of Commerce, the Court House and other juridical archives; municipal archives; church archives (for example: the archives of the Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church); Communist Party Archives; Red Cross Archives; public and private company archives (electricity, water, port companies); and private collections kept in museums, at home, or in private institutions. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the identification of the relevant repositories, EHRI has also found that certain archives, which were originally thought to hold Holocaust-related materials, do not in fact have such material. For example, it was found that not all municipal archives of cities with a Jewish community during the Second World War, had kept their collections, but had transferred them to local GSA branches.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Greece, archives and collections relevant to the period of the Holocaust in Greece can be found in a number of countries, some of which are partially covered by Holocaust-relevant archival guides. For Germany, for instance, there is Irith Dublon-Knebel’s overview *German Foreign Office Documents on the Holocaust in Greece* (2007), while for Italy, there are collections of documents edited by Daniel Carpi, *Italian Diplomatic Documents on the History of the Holocaust in Greece* (1941-1943), Tel Aviv, Diaspora Research Center-Tel Aviv University, 1999.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, relevant archival holdings are located at the Political Archive of the German Foreign Office in Berlin, the Federal Archives-Department Military Archives in Freiburg, the Federal Archives-The Central Office for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes in Lundwigsburg, and the Arolsen Archives. Finally, in Bulgaria archival holdings can be found at the Central State Archives in Sofia and the Central Military Archives in Veliko Turnovo.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, relevant archival holdings are located at the National Archives in Washington DC, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC, the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York, the Visual History Archive/USC Shoah Foundation in Los Angeles, the American Joint Distribution Committee Archives in New York, and the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Sterling Memorial Library (Yale University). A special note needs to be made about copies of the archives of the following Greek Jewish communities which were copied and made available for research at USHMM, but remain largely inaccessible for research in Greece itself for various reasons (including lack of resources). USHMM has completed its digitization in Larissa and Chalkida; digitization has been started in Volos, Ioannina, and Trikala; digitization may continue in Athens, Corfu and Rhodes.\r\n\r\nIn Israel, relevant archival holdings are located at the Yad Vashem Archives in Jerusalem, the Central Zionist Archives in Jerusalem, the Hagana History Archives in Tel Aviv, the Ghetto Fighters’ House Archives in Galilee, and the Institute of Contemporary Jewry, Oral History Division (Hebrew University).\r\n\r\nIn England, relevant archival holdings are located at the National Archives in Kew; in Spain, at the Archives of the Spanish Foreign Office in Madrid; in Switzerland, at the International Committee of the Red Cross Archives in Geneva; and in Austria, at the Central Europe Center for Research and Documentation (known as Centropa) in Vienna.",

                "history": "The Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded by Germany, Italy and other Axis states on 6 April 1941. The country capitulated on 17 April and Germans, Italians, Hungarians and Bulgarians occupied and partitioned the country. On 10 April 1941 the Germans troops entered Zagreb, and the Independent State of Croatia [Nezavisna država Hrvatska, NDH] was proclaimed by the representatives of the Ustaša movement. The Axis powers sponsored the NDH’s expansion through the incorporation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the complete Eastern Srijem region (today part of the Republic of Serbia). Conversely, they immediately and systematically began to chip away at Croatian sovereignty: Italy occupied and eventually annexed parts of Dalmatia, Hungary annexed Međimurje on the northern tip of Croatia. Both German and Italian troops had more or less free reign in their respective zones of influence, which covered virtually the entire territory of the NDH. The NDH existed until the end of the Second World War in May 1945.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War 23,000 to 24,000 Jews lived in Croatia out of an estimated total population of 2,481,000 according to the 1931 census. The NDH authorities immediately began introducing anti-Jewish measures, many also anti-Roma and anti-Serb. As in Nazi Germany, the NDH government defined being Jewish in racial terms. Between April 1941 and October 1942, the NDH decreed at least 30 laws and regulations on the national level and many more on provincial and local levels that established the status of Jews in the new state, regulated the confiscation and redistribution of Jewish property and dismantled Jewish communities as well as other Jewish organisations. On 30 April 1941, it issued three anti-Jewish laws that defined who was Jewish and determined their legal status: the Legal Provision on Citizenship, the Legal Provision on Racial Origins, and the Legal Provision on the Protection of Aryan Blood and the Honour of the Croatian People. During May of 1941, the Ustaša began to conduct mass-arrests, deportations to concentration camps and the killing of members of Croatian Jewry. The NDH authorities established concentration and labour camps as well as death camps for interned Jews. There were numerous concentration camps in the territory of the NDH, the largest one among them being Jasenovac. Many Jews fled to the Italian-annexed and occupied zones of the country, where they were relatively safe until September of 1943, when Italy capitulated. Only around 4,000 to 5,000 Croatian Jews survived the Second World War.\r\n\r\nAccording to official data from 1931, around 15,000 Roma lived in territories that would be included in the newly proclaimed Independent State of Croatia in 1941. Estimates assume, however, that 30,000 Roma actually lived in this area during the Second World War. The policy towards Roma was based on racial laws and aimed at their genocidal extermination. From May 1942, Roma from the whole country were systematically deported to camps within the country, especially to the Jasenovac camp, where they were tortured and killed. Roma were also deported to camps in Nazi Germany (Auschwitz, Dachau). Part of the Roma from these territories were also interned in fascist camps in Italy. Roma were also victims of mass crimes by Chetniks (Serbian) and German military units and some Roma joined the anti-fascist partisan resistance movement. The first known Roma partisan military unit was founded in this area. It is estimated that almost the entire Roma community perished in the war, between 15,000 and 30,000. In the first post-war population census conducted in 1948, only 405 declared themselves as Roma in the territory of today's Croatia.",
                "summary": "Before EHRI, there were only limited surveys available on Holocaust archives in Croatia, which had been conducted by the Croatian State Archives and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. EHRI updated the information on a dozen archival institutions, which it took over from the previous Claims Conference / Yad Vashem databases. Together with the addition of newly identified institutions, there are now some 30 CHIs in Croatia on the EHRI Portal. Next, EHRI identified the collections via a top-down approach starting with the institutions with the largest number of relevant collections (Croatian State Archive, The State Archive of the City of Zagreb; as well as those of cities like Slavonski Brod, Osijek, etc.).

EHRI was able to draw on pre-existing research, such as: Narcisa Lengel Krizman ed. *Zna li se: Antisemitizam – Holokaust – Antifašizam* (1996) also in English as *Anti-semitism, Holocaust, Anti-Fascism* (1997); Ivo and Slavko Goldstein’s *Holokaust u Zagrebu* (2001); Zlata Živaković-Kerže, *Stradanja i pamćenja: Holokaust u Osijeku i život koji se nastavlja* (2006); Đuro Zatezalo, Jadovno. Kompleks ustaških logora 1941, I–II (2007); Vladimir Geiger / Martina Grahek Ravančić / Marica Karakaš Obradov (eds.) *Logori, zatvori i prisilni rad u Hrvatskoj/Jugoslaviji 1941–1945, 1945–1951* (2010); Alexander Korb’s *Im Schatten des Weltkriegs: Massengewalt der Ustasa gegen Serben, Juden und Roma in Kroatien 1941–1945* (2013); Marica Karakaš Obradov, “Prisilne migracije židovskog stanovništva na području Nezavisne Države Hrvatske”, *Croatica Christiana periodica* 37:72 (2013); Marica Karakaš Obradov, “Iseljavanje Židova iz Hrvatske nakon Drugoga svjetskog rata”, Historijski zbornik 66:2 (2013); Ivo Goldstein, Jasenovac (2018); Zdravko Dizdar, *Logor Danica u Koprivnici* 1941–1942, 1–3, (2017 – 2020); Naida-Michal Brandl, *Židovi u hrvatskoj nakon Holokausta* (2023). \r\n\r\nAs a result, a number of useful finding aids were identified. Online search tools are provided by both the Croatian State Archives and the National and University Library:\r\n- Hrvatski arhivski informacijski sustav / Croatian archival information system (https://hais.arhiv.hr/HDA/) \r\n- Biblionet (http://biblionet.arhiv.hr/)\r\n- The National and University Library (https://www.nsk.hr)\r\n\r\nA more traditional guide with general information about archives in Croatia is Igor Karaman’s *Studije i prilozi iz arhivistike* (Zagreb: Arhiv Hrvatske, 1993).\r\n\r\nFor a general guide on archival holdings in the Republic of Croatia see Vida Pavliček, “Pregled arhivskih fondova i zbirki Republike Hrvatske. Rad na prikupljanju i obradi podataka”, Arhivski vjesnik 50:1 (2007): 9–32. Regarding the archival material on the Holocaust, Josip Kolanović published a paper “Holocaust in Croatia – Documentation and research perspectives” Arhivski vjesnik 39 (1996): 157–174 and in 2013, the Croatian State Archives published an online paper presenting Holocaust-relevant collections (http://zagreb.arhiv.hr/hr/teme/holokaust.htm). It should also be noted that most collections in the Croatian State Archive and other state archives throughout the country have their own finding aids with descriptions of what can be found in which box of an entire collection. Some collections are better explored than others, often depending on the interests of archivists who use the collections for PhD theses or other post-doc works. However, they are available only in the archives themselves, and not online. General Guide for Archival Holdings in Republic of Croatia (Pregled arhivskih fondova i zbirki Republike Hrvatske, Zagreb: Hrvatski državni arhiv, 2006–2007) is contemporary Croatian archives service obligatory finding aid, which provides basic data on archival holdings in Republic of Croatia in custody of archival, but also of non-archival institutions. It does not, however, single out “Holocaust” as a keyword. Its latest edition (2006) is not available in pdf.\r\n\r\nAs for surveys by third parties the USHMM has been intermittently active in Croatia since the late 1990s (Sporazum o suradnji između “United States Holocaust Memorial Museum-a” i Hrvatskog državnog arhiva. Bulletin. Hrvatski državni arhiv (Zagreb). 6:1–2 (1995): 17–18). During the 1990s, local experts surveyed and copied war-time material at the Zagreb State Archives. It leads an endeavor to digitalise material from other state archives in the country and pre-war records from Zagreb. The USHMM is also helping the Jewish Community in Zagreb archive to sort its material, which will later be digitalised. The microfilmed collections from the Second World War (surveyed in the 1990s), plus scanned material from the interwar period and the Second World War (ongoing survey) from different repositories around the country is gradually being put online. The work on the identification of the post-war material is in progress.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Croatian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAll collections are usually accessible to the public, but if a file refers to a person who was born less than 100 years ago, it will not be possible to copy that file. Each archival director is responsible for the approval of requests to scan or copy specific material submitted by individual research projects rather than through a more global agreement between institutions.\r\n\r\nAlthough important online search tools are available, they are of limited use for Holocaust scholars. Furthermore, keywords such as “Jewish” or “Holocaust” will not produce many results in these online search databases. Some collection descriptions on HAIS mention that “part of the material was copied for the needs of USHMM” (but typing “USHMM” into the search box will not lead one to collections copied for the USHMM).\r\n\r\nKnowledge of regional history, on how institutions were organized, and of who (or which political body) was in charge at given dates in time is essential to find relevant information within the body of archival material. In some cases, there is a high probability of identifying Holocaust-relevant files, but often it is more like “finding a needle in a haystack”. Researchers need to rely on assistance from local archivists to identify or at least narrow down the search for relevant information to a number of collections. However, this can still leave one with hundreds of boxes to consult without any firm indication of what they may contain.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Croatia**\r\n\r\n**C. I. In Croatia**\r\n\r\nEHRI identified and investigated Holocaust-relevant archival institutions and collections in Croatia in close cooperation with USHMM and Yad Vashem. The Croatian State Archive in Zagreb and the State Archive of the City of Zagreb are of particular importance. Two other state archives, in Osijek (a city with the second largest Jewish community in Croatia) and Rijeka (Fiume in Italian), a city in the northern Adriatic are equally important. These two archives are regional centres; Osijek has a rich Jewish history and was home to the second largest Jewish community in Croatia and during the Second World War the border town of Rijeka received thousands of Jewish refugees who had escaped To Italian held areas in NDH, or to the Italian territory. Three other cities with state archives and a relatively rich Jewish history are Varaždin, in the north, Slavonski Brod, which also has a relatively strong and as yet under-researched Jewish heritage, and Split, on the southern coast. Until the 19th century, Split’s Jewish community mostly consisted of Sephardic Jews, but this community also had roots dating back to the Roman period.\r\n\r\nApart from the State Archives, other important collection-holding institutions are the National and University Library in Zagreb (which stores interwar Jewish periodicals, some of which were published until April/May 1941), and the library and archive of the Jewish community center in Zagreb. At the time of writing, the latter is not yet open to the public as it is awaiting archival renovation and the sorting of its archival material into collections. There are smaller Jewish community archives in other Croatian cities and towns, which do not function as public institutions. One needs to first contact somebody from the local Jewish community to find out where they are and if their holdings can be consulted. However, the majority of archival collections of different Jewish communities in Croatia are held in the Jewish Historical Museum in Belgrade, Serbia.\r\n\r\nOther relevant institutions for Holocaust research in Croatia include the Documentation Center for Holocaust Victims and Survivors (CENDO), the Jasenovac Memorial and the Croatian History Museum of Croatia in Zagreb. The latter reported that they have some possibly interesting material concerning Croatian Jewish families within the Documentation and Information Department, and in the Photography department. However, the museum is under-staffed, so the archives have not been completely sorted and are not recognized as “Holocaust material” even though many of the families whose lives are documented perished during the war. The museum would like to see these materials labelled as Holocaust-related in the future. A similar situation applies to the Brod Regional Museum [Muzej Brodskog Posavlja] in Slavonski Brod.\r\n\r\nThe Archdiocesan Archives are now a part of the Croatian State Archive system, but some collections are held in a separate location within the church. Therefore, it has been added as a separate institution.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the USHMM and Yad Vashem, EHRI has yet to determine which archival institutions and collections outside of Croatia are relevant to Holocaust research on Croatia. Due to the fact that the territory of the NDH incorporated territory of the Eastern Srijem that s today’s Serbia as well as the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, some archives and museums in NW Serbia as well as those in Bosnia and Herzegovina, for example Banja Luka, Tuzla, Sarajevo, etc. have some documents relevant to Croatia. The Military Archives in Belgrade probably has archival collections relevant to the Holocaust in Croatia due to the fact that it still holds archival collections of the NDH and the Archives of Yugoslavia in Belgrade, is likely to hold relevant collections.",

                "history": "Hungary fell increasingly under the influence of Germany as the Nazi regime consolidated itself during the 1930s. When Germany began to redraw national boundaries in Europe, Hungary was able to regain territory it had lost due to the 1920 Trianon Treaty, including southern Slovakia (1938) and Subcarpathian Rus (1939) after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, and Northern Transylvania from Romania (1940). In November 1940, Hungary joined the Tripartite Pact. In April 1941, it took part in the occupation of Yugoslavia, and annexed the Bačka, the Baranya triangle, the Medimurje and the Prekmurje regions. On 27 June 1941, Hungary declared war on the Soviet Union. After Germany’s defeat at Stalingrad and other battles in which Hungary lost tens of thousands of its soldiers, the Regent of Hungary, Miklós Horthy, initiated clandestine peace negotiations with the Western Allies. As a result, German troops occupied Hungary on 19 March 1944. However, Horthy was allowed to remain regent. Following a thwarted attempt to leave war, on 15 October 1944, Horthy was replaced by the fascist Arrow Cross government. The German occupiers were driven out of Hungary by the Red Army on 13 April 1945.\r\n\r\nAccording to the 1941 census, Hungary with its annexed territories had a total population of about 14 million, including 725,000 Jews, among them some 400,000 in Hungary proper, and tens of thousands of Christians who were considered Jewish by racist criteria. From 1938 onwards, anti-Jewish legislation effectively excluded the Jews from Hungarian society depriving them of many of their civil rights and economic opportunities. Jewish men were forced to perform unarmed military labour service in the Hungarian Army. Thousands of them perished on the Eastern front. Additionally, already in the summer of 1941, Hungarian authorities deported some 20,000 Jews, including refugees and aliens, but also Hungarian citizens. They were driven to the occupied Soviet territories, where most of them were killed by the German SS with Ukrainian auxiliaries near Kamianets-Podilskyi in Ukraine. In January 1942, Hungarian military units and gendarmes murdered about 3,500 local people, including some 700 Jews, in Novi Sad and in its vicinity, in the Bačka region.\r\n\r\nDespite serious casualties and the increasingly antisemitic political climate, most of the Hungarian Jews could live in relative physical safety until March, 1944. However, after the German invasion, a large part of Jewry in Hungary was murdered. Due to the active participation of the Hungarian government, public administration, and law enforcement, the German authorities were able to deport nearly all the Jews from the provinces, close to 440,000 people, over a period of only 56 days between 15 May and 9 July 1944. With the exception of some 15,000 people who were sent to labour camps near Vienna, all the deportees were taken to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where about 75-80% of them, mostly women, children and the elderly, were murdered in gas chambers upon arrival, the others were sent to various labour camps, mostly within the Reich.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Germans’ plans, the approximately 200,000 Jews of Budapest were next in line to be locked into ghettos and then deported. From the end of June 1944, they had to live in so-called “yellow star houses”, nearly two thousand designated buildings throughout the city. The Jews in Budapest were spared from deportation to Auschwitz due to the course of the war. The persecution of Jews was resumed on 15 October, when the Arrow Cross Party came to power. Armed party militias killed thousands of Jews in the streets of Budapest, and tens of thousands were drafted for forced labour to build fortifications at the south-eastern border of the Greater German Reich in Austria. The remaining Jews were forced to move to a sealed-off ghetto in early December, whereas a so-called international ghetto was established for Jews with passports or protective documents issued by embassies of neutral countries. On 18 January, the Red Army liberated the ghettos. In Budapest, some 150,000 Jews survived in the two ghettos and in hiding. Between 1941 and 1945, more than half a million people, that is, two thirds of the Jewish population of the wartime territory of Hungary, was murdered by the Nazis and their Hungarian collaborators, among them 260,000 Jews from interwar Hungary.\r\n\r\nThe number of Roma living in the wartime territory of Hungary (1941-1944) is estimated at up to 200,000. Roma communities faced discrimination in the form of raids and forced labour from 1929 onwards. Anti-Roma state violence intensified after the takeover of the pro-Nazi Arrow Cross Party on October 15, 1944. From early November 1944 on, the Hungarian public administration and the gendarmerie rounded up Roma from Western Hungary, the vicinity of Budapest, and the annexed former Czechoslovak territories in the collection camp in the Star Fort of Komárom, where they were detained in inhumane conditions. Adults and youth declared able to work were deported to various concentration camps in Germany, including Dachau, Buchenwald, Bergen-Belsen, Mauthausen, and Ravensbrück. Many died or were permanently injured by cruel treatment and forced labour. While family members who remained in the Star Fort were later released to go home, plenty, especially the young and the elderly, perished from hunger or froze to death in Komárom or on their way back. From the autumn of 1944 to the spring of 1945, several atrocities and mass executions occurred throughout the country, leading to the deaths of hundreds of Hungarian Roma, including women and children. The number of identified victims of the Roma genocide in Hungary is about 1500, but the total death toll is still subject to ongoing research and debate.",
                "summary": "The National Archives of Hungary hold the largest collections relevant to Holocaust research in Hungary. Other key collection-holding institutions include the Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives, the Budapest Municipal Archives, the Historical Archives of the Hungarian State Security, the Military History Archives, and the Holocaust Memorial Centre, which are all situated in Budapest. EHRI has identified a significant number of Holocaust-relevant repositories in Hungary, a full list of which can be found in the extensive report. ",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Hungary: Pre-existing research and third-party surveys**\r\n\r\nThe first large-scale survey of Holocaust-related archival records in Hungary was launched in the late 1950s and early 1960s and was conducted by Elek Karsai and his associates on behalf of the National Agency of Hungarian Israelites (MIOK). It resulted in the publication of a three volume series – Benoschofsky Ilona, Karsai Elek (eds.), *Vádirat a nácizmus ellen. Dokumentumok a magyarországi zsidóüldözés történetéhez* 3 vols., Budapest: Magyar Izraeliták Országos Képviselete, Kiadói félvászonkötésben 1958-1967 – and a broad selection of documents known as “Series I” were made available on 180 microfilms in the Hungarian National Archives, Yad Vashem and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. In 1994, a follow-up project was launched by Ágnes Ságvári, which resulted in the creation of minor collections of selected Holocaust records in all the municipal (county) archives in Hungary, as well as a series of source publications. In 1993, a research guide to archival materials relevant for Jewish studies in Hungary (including some Holocaust-related parts as well) was published: György Haraszti and Géza Komoróczy (eds), *Magyar zsidó levéltári repertórium* [*Hungarian Jewish Archival Guide*] Vols. 1-2. Budapest: MTA Judaisztikai Kutatócsoport, 1993. Due to the re-organisation of the material, merging archives, newly found or added records and several other reasons, the information provided by this guide has remained incomplete, requiring updates and corrections.\r\n\r\nThe finding aids and descriptions available at archives in Hungary tend to provide scholars specialised in Holocaust Studies with little specific information. With the sole exception of the Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives, none of the archives in Hungary provide visitors with detailed finding aids in English. Only some offer online collection descriptions, but in most cases only a general overview of the holdings is available online. However, many institutions have launched digitisation projects and there is an increasing number of online finding aids.\r\n\r\nThe research teams of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Yad Vashem Archives have conducted extensive research in the previous two decades in Hungary. They prepared detailed collection-level and file-level descriptions for institutions of particular importance to Holocaust research, including the Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives, the National Archives of Hungary, the Budapest Municipal Archives, the Historical Archives of the State Security and the Institute and Museum of Military History.\r\n\r\nThe most recent major comprehensive documentary account on the topic in English is *The Holocaust in Hungary. Evolution of a Genocide* by Zoltán Vági, László Csősz and Gábor Kádár (Washington, DC: AltaMira Press-USHMM, 2013). The volume offers a selection of archival material from various archives in Hungary and abroad. The most relevant archival sources, especially on the history of the ghettoisation and deportation in 1944 are summarised in the entries of Randolph L. Braham (ed.), *Geographical Encyclopedia of the Holocaust in Hungary* (Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern University Press, 2013). \r\n\r\nEHRI’s experts on Hungary have made good use of the online finding aids on the microfilmed Hungarian records available on the USHMM website as well as of the valuable survey material we have obtained from colleagues at the Yad Vashem Archives. In addition, they have consulted archivists of the key collection-holding institutes.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Hungarian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAccording to the Act on public records, public archives and the protection of private archival holdings (in short: Archives Act, Act LXVI of 1995), public archives in Hungary were divided into national (general) archives, specialised state archives, municipal (city and county) archives, archives of public foundations and other public bodies, as well as private archives open to the public. The Public Records Act was modified by Act LXI of 2012, which brought about fundamental changes in the archival system. The Hungarian National Archives [Magyar Országos Levéltár], the central repository holding collections transferred from national government bodies as well as all county and most of the city archives, were integrated on 1 October 2012 into the newly established National Archives of Hungary [Magyar Nemzeti Levéltár], a centralised, state-controlled body. A few municipal archives have not been merged into these new central archives, including the Budapest Municipal Archives. In addition, there are several specialised archives, some 20 church and 20 Jewish community archives as well as other collection-holding institutions, including about 25 museums, major Budapest libraries, and private collections that hold records relevant for Holocaust research.\r\n\r\nIn Hungary, any person may, upon preliminary application, be granted free access to archival records held in public archives. Access to public records preserved in the National Archives of Hungary and its branch institutions are regulated by the Archives Act and its modifications since then (Amendment CXL of 1997. Enacting Clauses 19 and 20/1198. MKM), the Data Protection Act (LXIII of 1992) and the Privacy Act (LXV of 1995). One of the most important regulations concerning personal data of an individual mentioned in the records is that these data must not be published sooner than 30 years following the death of the person concerned, or if the year of death is unknown, for 90 years following the birth of the person concerned, or if both dates are unknown, for 60 years following the date of issue of the archival material concerned. “Personal data” is defined as any data that can be related to a certain natural person (“person concerned”) and any conclusion that can be drawn from such data about the person concerned.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Hungary**\r\n\r\n**C. I. In Hungary**\r\n\r\nIn Hungary, EHRI has so far identified a significant number of archival institutions, which are relevant for Holocaust research. EHRI has carried out archival descriptions in several of them: the Budapest-based Hungarian National Archives, the Budapest Municipal Archives, the Historical Archives of the Hungarian State Security, the Military History Archives, the Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives; the Holocaust Memorial Center; and the Pest County Archives.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nArchival sources pertaining to the Holocaust in Hungary can be found in the archives of all seven neighbouring countries (Austria, Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia) as well as in other foreign countries, most importantly Germany, Israel and the United States. Key foreign archives holding material pertaining to the Holocaust in Hungary include the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Archives, the Yad Vashem Archives, the Bundesarchiv, and the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington DC. While most records are written in Hungarian, finding aids and working languages differ in all these places. This continues to pose a serious challenge to researchers. Consequently, the identification and investigation of these archival documents require extensive international cooperation.\r\n",

After Hitler rose to power in Germany, some 60,000 Jews emigrated from the Third Reich to Mandatory Palestine, while about 220,000 moved there from other countries. Before the British victory at El Alamein in Egypt in November 1942, the British feared that Mandatory Palestine, like its neighbors, would be invaded by the German forces advancing from North Africa in an eastern direction. During the course of 1942, news of the mass murder of Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe reached Mandatory Palestine. The leadership of the Jewish community in Mandatory Palestine attempted to help rescue Jews in Europe, but its ability to accomplish anything to that effect was extremely limited. \r\n\r\nFor this country there are no sufficient findings on the history of Roma during the Second World War. EHRI would be pleased to receive any information. ",
                "summary": "Israeli archives store important Holocaust-relevant collections. They include vast amounts of personal documentation brought to the country by refugees and survivors of the Holocaust, as well as testimonies given by survivors during and after the war. These testimonies describe the survivors’ experiences in the ghettos, camps, hideaways and with the partisans. It is important to point out that refugees and immigrants in Mandatory Palestine corresponded with relatives still living in their countries of origin. The letters from their relatives contain important information regarding the situation in these countries before and during the Nazi-occupation and the immediate post-war period.\r\n\r\nThe Yad Vashem Archives, whose official activities date back to 1946, holds the largest number of Holocaust-related collections by far. When the Israeli Parliament entrusted Yad Vashem with the mission to commemorate the Shoah and its victims in 1953, Yad Vashem began to systematically collect Holocaust-related documentation from all kinds of sources.\r\n\r\nThe first documents arrived at Yad Vashem from the “Historical Commissions” and various documentation centres established after the war, mostly by Holocaust survivors, but also from public institutions, researchers and private individuals. Material collected in Israel was added to the documentation collected by Jews during the war in the ghettos, camps and hideaways, as well as materials collected in the first years after the war, for example in DP camps. Since its establishment, the Yad Vashem Archives have initiated activities with a view to collecting and copying Holocaust-related documents that have been housed in various archives in Europe and throughout the world. Over the years, they have collected extensive and comprehensive documentation in various forms. For more detailed information on the activities and holdings of the Yad Vashem Archives, see the extensive report.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Yad Vashem, the Ghetto Fighters House, the Massuah Institute for the Study of the Holocaust, the Moreshet Mordechai Anielevich Memorial and the Kiddush Hashem Archive are important institutions that hold and collect Holocaust-related sources. Historically, these institutions were connected to different political movements. Furthermore, the Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People, the National Library of Israel, the Wiener Library for the Study of the Nazi Era and the Holocaust at Tel Aviv University, the Central Zionist Archives, the Jabotinsky Institute in Israel, Beit Theresienstadt, and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee should be mentioned here. Many more institutions in Israel hold Holocaust-related archives, such as the Leo Baeck Institute and the Lavon Institute for Labour Research. For more information on these institutions, see the extensive report. \r\n\r\nFinally, official documentation from the British authorities in Mandatory Palestine can be found in Israel, as well as documentation from Jewish organizations and public institutions of that period. These sources reflect the many ways in which immigrants arrived in Mandatory Palestine, and the hardships they endured, but also rescue attempts undertaken by both individual and political or public institutions.",
                "extensive": "Disclaimer: The EHRI Extensive Report was updated in 2024.\r\n\r\n**A. EHRI approach to Israel: Pre-existing research and third-party surveys, archival guides and expert support**\r\n\r\nIn Israel, EHRI was able to rely on and cooperate with Israel Archives Network, or RE'I Project of the National Library and State Archives in Israel which in 2013 conducted a survey, under the auspices of the Prime Minister's Office, to identify and map most archives in Israel. In the process, information was collected on archives holding Holocaust-related material, as well as on the documentation itself. The RE'I Project aimed at building an infrastructure, creating uniform standards for the archives in Israel, ensuring proper maintenance of documentation in various archives in Israel, and granting easy archival access to the public in Israel.\r\n\r\nThe RE’I Project has established that there are some 600 archives in Israel. Whether they hold Holocaust-relevant sources, and to what extent, was largely unknown before.\r\n\r\nIn the first implementation stage of the RE’I Project, a survey was conducted in all the archives that had been designated by the project steering committee. Surveyors were recruited to visit the various archives and to conduct an online survey via a dedicated survey system provided by Ransys Feedback Technologies. The survey was conducted over the course of a year. At the start of the survey, a list of 350 archives was available.\r\n\r\nCooperation between EHRI and RE'I, which was facilitated by Yad Vashem and started in the planning stages of the survey, allowed for the insertion of questions relating to the existence of Holocaust-related materials in the archives to be surveyed. The questions were designed to ascertain whether or not any Holocaust-related documentation existed in a particular archive; the nature of the documentation (personal documents, official documents, testimonies, memoirs); and the number of relevant collections in the archive. Likewise, the archives were asked to briefly describe the relevant collections and to provide their signatures.\r\n\r\nAbout 200 of the archives surveyed responded that they had Holocaust-related documentation. A large number of the archives also mentioned the types of existing documentation in their possession. Only a few, however, responded to questions regarding the number of relevant collections and their signatures. It appears that the reason for this is that many of the archives in Israel do not use the practice of registering documentation at the collection level, but rather at the file level. Another reason is the fact that some of the documentation is dispersed in files or collections pertaining to other topics. This hinders the identification and description of the documentation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, most of the relevant information gained from the RE'I survey pertains to the identification of Israeli archives holding various types of Holocaust-related material. In some cases there is also a very general description of the documentation. For the most part, it is difficult to extract quantitative data, collection signatures or detailed descriptions from the survey. Some of the archives are already included in the EHRI portal. More detailed information on the documentation in some of the archives, and its inclusion in the EHRI portal, will be possible once the archives become accessible in the framework of the RE'I project and the data is imported.\r\n\r\nBelow are examples of data provided by archives that participated in the survey, regarding Holocaust-related documentation in their possession. These examples represent the various types of archives in Israel: municipal or community archives – cities, communal settlements (moshavim), kibbutzim; archives of public and private organisations, institutions and political parties; and archives dedicated to a specific topic.\r\n\r\nMoshav and kibbutz archives primarily hold personal documentation of past and present members, refugees and Holocaust survivors, which is often kept in their personal files. The most prevalent types of documentation in these archives are testimonies and memoirs. Some of the archives have reported that the relevant material is scattered among various files and difficult to identify.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that some of the kibbutz and moshav members and some of the archives in these locations have submitted the originals or copies of the documentation in their possession to archives that primarily collect Holocaust-related documentation, such as Lohamei Haghetaot, Yad Ya'ari, Masuah and Moreshet. For example, the Yad Vashem Archives contain record group O.90 which includes documentation collected from kibbutzim. Since the survey did not include a question relating to original vs. copied documentation, it is difficult to say how much of the documentation is original. It should also be noted that some of the archives included information on Holocaust commemoration in their reports on Holocaust-related documentation.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- Kibbutz Beit Hashita archive – 50 items. Testimonies of survivors and orphans adopted by the kibbutz. There is also material on the absorption of youth groups and groups that were trained in the kibbutz and went on to establish other kibbutzim.\r\n- Kfar Yehoshua archive – requests for certificates; documentation of the youth groups that arrived from Germany and Romania, documentation in members' personal files.\r\n- Kibbutz Hafetz Haim archive – 16 files. Testimonies of kibbutz members, most of whom were Holocaust survivors.\r\n- Kibbutz Mayanot archive – 25 testimonies; letters of Yosef Kaplan, Shomer Hatzair emissary in Warsaw, who perished in the Holocaust and who corresponded with kibbutz members; documentation on Haviva Reich and other kibbutz members.\r\n- Kibbutz Hatzerim archive – 60 items. File on the Teheran children; information on kibbutz members who were Holocaust survivors.\r\n- Yad Ya'ari Hashomer Hatzair Archive – about 20 collections, including Hashomer Hatzair in Poland; Hashomer Hatzair in Yugoslavia; the bureau in Paris; Hashomer Hatzair worldwide; personal collections of Abba Kovner, Shalom Cholawski, Chaika Grossman, the sculptor Nathan Rapoport.\r\n- Machon Lavon Labor Movement Archive – 2 collections. The Hehalutz liaison office in Geneva - Nathan Schwalb (Dror) archive; collection of certificates from the Holocaust period.\r\n- Maccabee Archive – personal stories of athletes from Vilna who were banned from the 1936 Olympics by the Nazi regime.\r\n- Yad Chaim Weizmann Archive – correspondence regarding requests for rescue and aid and memos describing the situation of the Jews in Europe.\r\n- Felicia Blumental Music Center archive – Huberman archive: personal correspondence of Bronislaw Huberman regarding the Nazi rise to power in Germany in the framework of a pan-European movement and correspondence with the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler regarding the banishment of Jews from cultural life in Germany due to the antisemitic policies of the Nazis.\r\n- Leo Baeck Institute for the Study of German and Central European Jewry archive – unknown number of unique and rare letters, diaries and personal testimonies from the Holocaust period.\r\n- Hebrew University archive – There is not an exact number of items. Pre-war acceptance applications from individuals who anticipated the future and attempted to escape from Europe; diplomas awarded to students; documentation of project \"Treasures of the Diaspora\": campaign to salvage materials during the war, especially towards its end in 1945 and afterwards, when it was possible to move freely in those areas. The university sent missions to salvage materials, books and archives of Jewish communities in Europe. The administrative documentation that was produced during the campaign is found in the archive and the materials themselves are today in the National Library and the Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Israeli archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nMany archives in Israel contain a great deal of personal documentation, created or preserved by victims and survivors of the Holocaust, which reflects their experiences. Refugees and survivors had or have a variety of personal papers in their possession which reflect their experiences before, during and after the Shoah. They also document their histories and the events they witnessed in their former places of residence in Europe. A large portion of this material has been deposited and new material continues to arrive at various archives throughout Israel.\r\n\r\nAn increasing awareness of the great importance of Holocaust-era personal documentation held by private individuals in Israel has led the archives of Yad Vashem and the Ghetto Fighters' House in recent years to appeal to the Israeli public to deposit such documentation in their archives. These campaigns have resulted in the addition of thousands of items, mostly original documents, to the archives' collections.\r\n\r\nThe Yad Vashem Law, enacted by the Israeli Parliament in 1953, defined the institution’s mission as “to collect, examine and publish testimony of the disaster and the heroism it called forth…”, thus commemorating the Shoah and its victims. As a result, the Yad Vashem Archives were established which have collected Holocaust-related documentation from various sources ever since. However, efforts to document the Holocaust had begun long before 1953. From the Nazi rise to power in Germany, and throughout the Second World War, people documented the events as they were taking place, often under the harshest conditions. Even before the enormity of the disaster became clear, Mordechai Shenhavi initiated a Commemorative Project for the Jews of Europe that would include an archive. The Yad Vashem Archives officially started operating in 1946, under the direction of Dr. Sarah Friedlander, who had been born in Budapest and saved on the Kasztner train. The first documents arrived at Yad Vashem from the “Historical Commissions” and various documentation centres, as well as public institutions, researchers and private individuals. Material collected in Israel was added to the documentation collected by Jews during the war in the ghettos, camps and hideaways. Immediately after the war, centres for documentation and the collection of testimonies were established in many places around the world, including Munich, Warsaw, Lodz, Lublin, Paris, Bratislava, Budapest and other locations.\r\n\r\nSince their establishment, the Yad Vashem Archives have initiated activities with a view to collecting and copying Holocaust-related documents that have been housed in various archives in Europe and throughout the world. With the fall of the “Iron Curtain” and the opening of archives in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s, the reproduction project has been greatly expanded.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results in Israel**\r\n\r\nAfter decades of collecting Holocaust-relevant sources and original research in the field, Yad Vashem is clearly the most important record-holding institution in Israel. With over 210,000,000 pages of documentation it stores the largest collection of Holocaust documents in the world. The collections include over 131,000 survivor testimonies; over 500,000 photographs and approximately 4.8 million names registered in the Hall of Names.\r\n\r\nIt was crucial to include collection data held by Yad Vashem in the EHRI portal. In EHRI’s first phase, It was decided to divide the work into two steps. In the first step, descriptions of record groups and sub-record groups existing in the Yad Vashem database were manually added to the EHRI portal. Alongside the addition of the descriptions to the portal, dozens of authority entries were developed – especially personalities and organizations – which were later linked to the appropriate collection descriptions. In the second step, we added about 47 record groups and sub-record groups comprising 11,000 units of description in an IT-driven integration process.\r\n\r\nIn EHRI’s second phase, the export activity of Yad Vashem had two goals. Firstly, EHRI wanted to update Yad Vashem’s existing content on the EHRI portal, improve the quality of the descriptions and add new records. Secondly, the goal was to have a sustainable connection between Yad Vashem and the EHRI portal, allowing content updates and additions of new material on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, an additional 45 record groups, which have an internal hierarchical structure, have been exported to the portal. There were several challenges in the export process, including the definition of the export structure and standardization of the data; development of new workflows while bearing in mind that they should be designed to allow automatization in the future; and the creation of a new service in the Yad Vashem digital infrastructure for publishing data in a sustainable way.\r\n\r\nThe team used the EAD conversion tool provided by EHRI to create the EAD files as it allows for the creation of the EADs in a way which is consistent with the constraints requested by the EHRI project.\r\n\r\nThe EAD records were published using the Metadata Publication Tool provided by EHRI. This tool allows exposure of the EAD records for harvesting. The export was done in two languages, Hebrew and English, and is available in the portal. During EHRI-3, and following the changes to the data integration infrastructure introduced during this phase, the data exchange workflow was further sustained by the development of a bespoke API by YV, ensuring future updates of their archival descriptions. More than 1,400 additional record groups have been exported to the portal. Currently, the record groups are being linked to the corresponding record groups in other institutions present on the EHRI portal, since most of these record groups are copied collections acquired by the Yad Vashem archive.  \r\n\r\nApart from Yad Vashem there are many other repositories in Israel that hold Holocaust-related documentation and collect materials on this subject. Such archives include (in a non-exhaustive fashion):\r\n\r\n*American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, Jerusalem Branch*\r\n\r\nFounded during the First World War, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) was the first Jewish organisation in the United States to dispense large-scale funding for international relief. In its wake, the First World War had sown the seeds of many additional catastrophes—pogroms, epidemics, famine, revolution, and economic ruin—and JDC played a major role in rebuilding the devastated communities of Eastern Europe and Mandatory Palestine. JDC’s relief activities, emigration aid, and rescue operations critically followed the Nazi rise to power and the outbreak of the Second World War. After the war, JDC supported and resettled survivors and help rebuild the remnant Jewish communities of Europe. The JDC Archives house one of the most significant collections in the world for the study of modern Jewish history. The JDC Archives are located in two centres, one at JDC’s New York headquarters and the second in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n*Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People*\r\n\r\nThe Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People (CAHJP), established in 1939, is now a subsidiary of the National Library of Israel. This archive includes millions of pages of original and copied documentation related to Jewish communities, including information about those communities before, during, and after World War II. For instance, they hold 1,600 archives of hundreds of Jewish communities, local, national and international Jewish organisations and private collections of many outstanding Jewish personalities. Today, this archive contains the most extensive collection of documents, pinkassim (registers) and other records of Jewish history from the Middle Ages to the present day.\r\n\r\n*Central Zionist Archives*\r\n\r\nThe Zionist Archives were founded in 1919 in Berlin. With the rise to power of the Nazis in 1933, the Archives were transferred to the Jewish Agency building in Jerusalem. Over the years, the collections expanded and after the Second World War an increased effort was made to bring the scarce archival material that had survived the war to Israel. In 1956, the 24th Zionist Congress declared the Central Zionist Archives to be the historic archives of the Zionist Movement, of the World Zionist Organization and of the Jewish Agency. The Central Zionist Archives act as the historic archives of the World Zionist Organization, the Jewish Agency, the Jewish National Fund, the United Israel Appeal and the World Jewish Congress. In addition, they hold archives of organisations and institutions of the Jewish population in the Land of Israel, as well as 1,500 personal archives, including on the heads and leaders of the Zionist Movement and the national funds and various personalities who have been active in the Zionist movement.\r\n\r\n*Ganzach Kiddush Hashem Archive*\r\n\r\nThe Kiddush Hashem Archive (in Hebrew, Ganzach Kiddush Hashem), an Orthodoxy-affiliated Holocaust institution, was founded in 1964 by the Holocaust researcher Rabbi Moshe Prager \"with the aim of commemorating the destroyed Jewish world, the heroism of the Jewish soul during the Holocaust, and the miracle of the Jewish People’s rebirth in Israel\". For 60 years the archive has gathered about 300,000 photographs in the Photograph Archive, about 2,000,000 documents in the Document Archive, approximately 40,000 textbooks in the Library as well as about 2000 video testimonies.\r\n\r\n*Ghetto Fighters' House*\r\n\r\nThe Ghetto Fighters' House – Itzhak Katzenelson Holocaust and Jewish Resistance Heritage Museum, an institution historically affiliated with the Zionist Labour movement, was founded in 1949 by a community of Holocaust survivors, members of the Jewish underground in the ghettos of Poland, and veterans of partisan units, to be a place of testimony that would tell the story of the Jewish People in the 20th century in general, and during the Second World War in particular. At the centre of this chronicle are the manifestations of Jewish resistance: the organised uprisings of Jews in the ghettos and camps, and the Jews who fought in partisan units and the armies of the Allied forces. The Ghetto Fighters’ House archive holds over 2,500,000 objects, including letters, certificates, diaries and testimonies (written, audio and video), films, photographs and displays. The archive collections comprise the history of the Jewish nation on all five continents during the first half of the 20th century and cover a wide range of areas such as the spiritual life, traditions and religion, society, education, economics, Holocaust and resistance, and the nation’s revival in the Land of Israel.\r\n\r\n*Jabotinsky Institute in Israel*\r\n\r\nThe Jabotinsky Institute in Israel was founded in 1937 with the aim of collecting and serving as a repository for documents, publications and photographic material associated with Ze'ev Jabotinsky and the Revisionist Movement. Today, about 400 personal archives of Ze'ev Jabotinsky and his family are stored in the Institute, as well as archives of the leaders of the Revisionist Movement. In addition, the collection includes 215 archives relating to the various branches of the National Movement and its institutions such as the Union of Zionists Revisionists (Hatzohar); The New Zionist Organization (N.Z.O); The Betar Youth movement and its Israeli and international branches; The National Labor Federation; and Keren Tel-Hai.\r\n\r\n*Massuah Institute for the Study of the Holocaust*\r\n\r\nThe Massuah Institute, an institution historically affiliated with the Zionist liberal Progressive Party, contains a museum and an international seminar centre designed to evoke discourse on the significance of the Holocaust in our contemporary society and culture. The Document Archive comprises a collection of documents and publications related to the Holocaust, the Jewish world prior to the Holocaust – community institutions, youth movements and collections of personal documents. It is the chief archive of the history of the Hanoar Hazioni and Akiva youth movements. The documents are arranged according to subject in 12 units. Among them are unique collections of postal items from the time of the Holocaust, personal testimonies of Holocaust survivors and personal archives.\r\n\r\n*Moreshet*\r\n\r\nEstablished in 1961, Moreshet, Mordechai Anielevich Memorial Holocaust Study and Research Centre, affiliated with the Hashomer Hatzair movement, is dedicated to the commemoration of Jewish organised resistance during the Second World War and the Holocaust. The Moreshet archive holds a vast body of testimonies – personal and collective, collected in the years following the liberation and later on. The unique documents preserved in the Moreshet archive include many documents relating to the underground movement that operated in the Vilna ghetto, the pioneer underground in Hungary, documentation of the Slovakian revolt and other documents about the support and rescue of Jewish refugees during and after the war. Another interesting section in the archive is a collection of more than a hundred personal war diaries, which give a direct insight into the experiences and feelings of their writers. Finally, it holds a fascinating collection of arts and craft works that survived the war.\r\n\r\n*National Library of Israel*\r\n\r\nThe National Library of Israel includes a growing number of collections, such as but not limited to:\r\n- A nearly complete collection of secondary literature on the Holocaust in tens of languages\r\n- Archives of individual cultural heroes, artists, scholars, and authors who perished in the Holocaust, emigrated or fled due to rising European anti-Semitism, survived the Holocaust, or created art and culture related to the Holocaust (including documents from Stefan Zweig, Avraham Sutzkever and the cultural life in the Vilna Ghetto, Anita Shapira, and others)\r\n- Archival material related to the Land of Israel during WWII and Jewish Soldiers during the war, as well as the relocation of survivors to Palestine and later the State of Israel\r\n- Several oral history collections and ethnographic recordings related to the Holocaust and its survivors, particularly but not exclusively materials gathered by the Oral History Division of the Hebrew University\r\n- A music collection that includes thousands of recordings of Holocaust related music\r\n- Collections of published material by and for the She'erit Hapelatah, including ritual texts, newspapers, children's books, and others, including a complete set of the Survivors' Talmud \r\n- Several diaries of Holocaust survivors, including that of Menachem Oppenheim written in the margins of his prayer book\r\n- The Historical Jewish Press site, includes hundreds of thousands of pages of full-text searchable Jewish newspapers from Europe and around the world from the 1930s and 1940s\r\n- Meta-data about some of the items in the collections that were distributed by Jewish Cultural Reconstruction\r\n- The USC Shoah Foundation (USC SFI) has partnered with the National Library of Israel to provide Israeli users with the first countrywide access to USC SFI's entire Visual History Archive, including testimonies from more than 52,000 Holocaust survivors and hundreds of survivors of the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks\r\n\r\n*Beith Theresienstadt*\r\n\r\nBeit Terezin archives contain original documents in addition to photocopies of documents stored in other institutions, all pertaining to the ghetto period, and including a catalogue listing details of about 160,000 prisoners of Ghetto Theresienstadt. Over 900 files are classified under topics such as: art, literature, self-administration, medicine, labor department, children’s homes, children’s comics, music, academic studies, research, personal testimonies, and biographical information.\r\n\r\nAn integral part of the archive is the library which contains about 5,000 books, periodicals, catalogues, sheets of music composed and performed in the ghetto, documentary films, audio recordings, in Hebrew and other languages.\r\n\r\nThe world’s largest collection of drawings, paintings and sculptures created by adults and children while they were interned in Ghetto Theresienstadt is perhaps the “backbone” of the archive, and also includes Judaica objects and everyday objects.\r\n\r\n*The Wiener Library for the Study of the Nazi era and the Holocaust at Tel Aviv University*\r\n\r\nThe Wiener Library for the Study for the Study of the Nazi Era and the Holocaust is a steadily growing research library and comprises old and new publications on the Third Reich, during and between the two world wars, Jewish communities in Europe, the Holocaust, anti-Semitism, and fascism throughout the world. As a research library affiliated to the Sourasky Central Library of Tel Aviv University, it offers access to extensive archival sources, books, journals, and databases for researchers worldwide. The library continues to develop and enhance its collections, provides guidance in retrieving information and locating material, initiates conferences, seminars and lecture series, encourages and coordinates research projects, and collaborates with scholars, research institutes, archives and other research libraries.\r\n\r\n*Shem Olam, Faith and the Holocaust Institute for Education Documentation and Research*\r\n\r\nThe Shem Olam Institute has harnessed itself and others to carry out research using historical scientific tools, while uncovering documents and unfamiliar sources relating to the world of values, faith, religious and spiritual life, which focus attention on coping in the Holocaust. \r\n\r\nThe EHRI Portal furthermore provides collection descriptions from the Leo Baeck Institute and other institutions.

                "history": "In March 1919, Benito Mussolini founded a movement called “Fasci di combattimento”, which became the Partito Nazionale Fascista (PNF) in November 1921. On 28 October 1922 he organised the “March on Rome”, following which King Vittorio Emanuele III of Savoy invited him to form a new government. Mussolini transformed the government into a dictatorship and then into a totalitarian state. After Italy left the League of Nations in 1937, the “Rome-Berlin Axis”, proclaimed in 1936, developed into a closer military alliance, the “Pact of Steel”, in 1939. Having pursued an expansionist foreign policy in the Mediterranean and in Africa throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, the Kingdom of Italy entered the war alongside Germany on 10 June 1940. Its assault on Greece in October 1940 and the military struggles in the Balkans and in North Africa triggered German interventions. In turn, Italy joined Germany’s invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. On 10 July 1943 the Allies, who had already occupied the Italian colonies in Africa (Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Libya), landed in Sicily. Two weeks later, on 25 July, the king and the Gran Consiglio del Fascismo toppled Mussolini, who was arrested. In early September, the new Italian leadership signed a separate peace agreement with the Allies. At this point, Italy's empire still encompassed the Dodecanese Islands (centred on Rhodes, today part of Greece), and extended to Greater Albania, Montenegro, and parts of Dalmatia (today part of Croatia) and Slovenia. However, the Allies were already in the process of invading southern Italy. This caused Germany to step in and occupy the remaining parts of Italy the Allies had not yet conquered. German forces also took over the Italian zones of occupation in Yugoslavia, Greece, and France. Parts of northern Italy were de facto annexed by the German Reich, designated as the Operationszonen Alpenvorland and Adriatisches Küstenland. While the king and his government fled south, Mussolini was freed from prison by SS paratroopers and was allowed to set up the Italian Social Republic [Repubblica Sociale Italiana, RSI] in Salò, northern Italy. The war front advanced very slowly: Rome was liberated in June 1944, Milan and the North in April 1945, when German forces withdrew from Italy altogether.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Italy had a total population of approximately 42 million people (not including the colonies). Its Jewish community, one of the oldest and most integrated in Europe, numbered about 47,000 people. Unlike the Nazi party, the PNF did not include anti-Judaism in its Statute until 1938, and there were Jews who joined the PNF. Notwithstanding this fact, Mussolini veered towards public and generalised anti-Jewish action halfway through the 1930s. In the autumn of 1938, this translated into the implementation of harsh anti-Jewish legislation based on biological racism resembling the German Nuremberg Laws. Many adults were coerced into forced labour (1942) and foreign Jews saw almost all their residence permits cancelled (1938); those who stayed on were later (1940) interned in the camp at Ferramonti and in other smaller camps. Still, between 1938 and 1943 there was no systematic state violence against Jews and they were not deported. Apart from some limited exceptions, Italian authorities in the occupied territories did not grant any requests by the Croatian Ustasha or the Germans to hand over Jews. When the Germans occupied Italy in 1943, the situation of the Jews in the central and northern half part of Italy worsened drastically. Jews were arrested by both the German and Italian police and gathered in provincial camps that were situated in various buildings or in town jails; from there they were transferred to the national internment camp, first at Fossoli, then at Bolzano. Here, the German police organised their deportation. The vast majority of deportees was sent to Auschwitz. The Jews of Operationszone Adriatisches Küstenland were arrested directly by the Germans and interned in the Risiera di San Sabba in Trieste, from where they were deported directly to Auschwitz. Over 300 Jews died in massacres in various places and of the approximately 7,500 deported Jews, a little over 800 survived. Some thousand Jews took part in the Resistance. The remaining 30,000 or more lived in hiding, were able to reach Switzerland or the already liberated South. Overall, about 7,000 Jews from Italy perished during the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nAfter the First World War, there were some thousands of Roma and Sinti living in the Kingdom of Italy. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Fascist government issued various persecutory measures to prevent the immigration of Sinti and Roma. While the escalation of anti-Roma governmental measures (a procedural escalation) began as early as the end of 1937, the entry of Italy into the war in June 1940 led to a further series of measures such as surveillance and ultimately the internment of civilians who were considered as a \"threat to the state\", among them Sinti and Roma. They were deported by the Italian police to camps within Italy, sent into banishment or put under police surveillance. After the German occupation in September 1943, some Sinti and Roma were deported by the German police.",
                "summary": "EHRI has so far identified over 90 archival institutions which hold Holocaust-relevant resources in Italy. These institutions can be roughly divided into public institutions such as the City Archives [Archivi Comunali], the State Archives (Archivi di Stato), the [Central State Archive [Archivio Centrale dello Stato]](https://www.esercito.difesa.it/storia/Ufficio-Storico-SME), the [Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [Archivio del Ministero degli Affari Esteri]](https://www.esteri.it/it/uapsds/archivio-storico-e-biblioteca/archivio-storico-diplomatico/), and the [Archives of the Army General Staff [Archivio Storico dell’Esercito]](https://www.esercito.difesa.it/storia/Ufficio-Storico-SME). The Archives of the Army General Staff allows limited access only. Furthermore, there are private archives such as the Parish and Diocesan Archives [Archivi Parrocchiali e Diocesani, which belong to the Catholic Church] and the Archives of the Jewish Communities [Archivi delle Comunità Ebraiche] of which the Rome, Florence and Venice branches hold particularly significant Holocaust-related collections. The Institutes for the History of the Resistance Movement network [Istituti per la storia della Resistenza], which has a [central seat in Milan](https://www.reteparri.it/) and a leading institute in Turin, holds records on the period 1943-1945 and focuses on documenting anti-fascist activity. The leading archive for documents concerning anti-Jewish persecutions in Italy is the Foundation Jewish Contemporary Documentation Center [CDEC, Fondazione Centro di Documentazione Ebraica Contemporanea] in Milan. The Center has produced the most detailed database documenting the history of the Italian Jews during the Holocaust period, which is now also available online (see below). [The National Museum of Italian Jewry and the Shoah [Museo Nazionale dell’Ebraismo Italiano e della Shoah, MEIS]](https://meis.museum/) in Ferrara and the Museum of the Shoah [Museo della Shoah] in Rome, are under construction and, for this reason, have not yet been the object of EHRI’s survey work.\r\n\r\nOutside of Italy, EHRI found that the State Archives in Rijeka, Croatia, have four collections pertaining to the Holocaust period. Especially important, however, are the vast holdings on Italy, which EHRI was able to identify at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.",
                "extensive": "Disclaimer: The EHRI Extensive Report was updated in 2024.\r\n\r\n**A. EHRI approach to Italy: Pre-existing research, archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nLacking a pre-existing specific, thematic guide about Holocaust documentation in Italy, the EHRI approach to Italy was based on two pillars. The first focused on the collections held by the Foundation Jewish Contemporary Documentation Center (CDEC). The bulk of research on the Holocaust in Italy has been carried out by the scholars of this institution, which began collecting documents in the 1960s and now holds a large number of copy collections from many of the Italian State Archives. These fragments have been used as a directory for deeper investigation in their originating institutions. The second pillar focused on research concerning the persecution of the Jews in Italy.\r\n\r\nGeneral guides to the Italian archival heritage are available on both paper and in digital format. See, for example, the *General Guide to the State Archives* [*Guida generale degli Archivi di Stato*, a cura di Claudio Pavone, Piero D’Angiolini, Roma, 1966-1969], which is also available online through a dedicated platform where information can be easily searched: http://www.guidageneralearchivistato.beniculturali.it/\r\n\r\nAs for the diocesan archives, a useful paper guide has been published as a special issue of the Journal *Rassegna degli Archivi di Stato in 1998. See, Guida degli Archivi diocesan d’Italia*, a cura di V. Monachino, E. Boaga, L. Osbat, S. Palese, Roma, Ministero per i beni culturali e ambientali. Ufficio centrale per i Beni Archivistici, 1998.\r\n\r\nThe Central State Archives provides access to interviews from the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education with Italian Holocaust survivors, available through the online portal Ti racconto la storia: voci dalla Shoah: http://www.shoah.acs.beniculturali.it/.\"\r\n\r\nEHRI has found the web portal of the Archival Superintendencies, Sistema Informativo Unificato per le Soprintendenze Archivistiche (SIUSA) particularly useful for navigating the archives of local Jewish communities: http://siusa.archivi.beniculturali.it/. In particular, it is worth mentioning that there is athe  thematic section devoted to the Archives for the Jewish history (Archivi per la storia dell’ebraismo):  https://siusa-archivi.cultura.gov.it/cgi-bin/siusa/pagina.pl?RicProgetto=ebrais\r\n\r\nOn the SIUSA web portal, there is also a useful “Guide to Archives of the Resistance” [Guida agli Archivi della Resistenza]: http://siusa.archivi.beniculturali.it/cgi-bin/pagina.pl?TipoPag=strumcorr&Chiave=27763. As for the numerous collections of the Institutes for the History of the Resistance, their collections can be browsed through an integrated web portal at: http://www.reteparri.it/patrimonio/\r\n\r\nApart from SIUSA, other databases and web-portals that have been useful in the identification of Holocaust-relevant archival institutions and collections include Sistema Archivistico Nazionale – http://san.beniculturali.it – as well as Sistema Informativo degli Archivi di Stato (SIAS): http://sias.archivi.beniculturali.it/cgi-bin/pagina.pl?RicVM=archivi\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Italian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAs a systematic cataloguing of Holocaust-related material scattered throughout Italian archival institutions has not yet been done at a national nor local level, a good knowledge of the history of the Italian administrative bodies together with authoritative historiographical works can help in the task of the identification of Holocaust related material. High and medium level archival descriptions – in some cases also full inventories – of the documentation held by the wide network of public and private institutions in Italy are available online thanks to an integrated and continuously updated web portal, the National Archival System [Sistema Archivistico Nazionale, SAN]. It works as a national access point to information on archival resources . However, these descriptions are often insufficient to identify the collections within which Holocaust-related documentation is present. For example, the Central State Archives in Rome hold a large amount of documentation about all aspects of persecution of the Jews, but this is only partially reported in both the online and paper finding aids. The same goes for the State Archives, where scholars can definitely find useful documentation in the “Questura” and “Prefettura” fonds, even though the finding aids do not always mention the presence of this kind of material.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is important to note that there have been a number of initiatives and projects aimed to make material and documentation about the Holocaust accessible to a wider audience in recent years. For example, the State Archives of Venice are digitising documents related to the persecution of the Jews in Venice; the State Archives of Trieste are working on a project aiming to describe and index their Holocaust related documentation (especially those related to the Coroneo prison, which are very important for the identification of the victims arrested and/or deported from Trieste; and the Municipal (or City) Archives of Milan are reordering their collection on the full 1938 Racial census (more than 3,500 papers, which refer to every Jewish family residing in Milan) and are planning to write descriptions for this documentation.\r\n\r\nWhile both the Central State Archives and regional State Archives hold documentation that enables research on the administrative machinery behind the persecution of the Jews, researchers can find material documenting the impact of this persecution from the victims’ perspectives at Jewish institutions and archives. This is the case of the Foundation “Contemporary Jewish Documentation Center” [Fondazione Centro di Documentazione Ebraica Contemporanea, CDEC], whose collections and databases are primarily focused on the personal documents and testimonies of Holocaust victims and partisan Jews. The historical Archives of the Union of the Italian Jewish Community [Unione delle Comunità ebraiche Italiane, UCEI] provides documentation about the reactions of the top Jewish political and administrative management to the Fascist regime, racial laws and persecution, as well post-war policies and activities for rebuilding the Italian Jewish communities after the Holocaust. It also holds relevant documentation about the relationships established with the State administrative bodies. This kind of documentation can be found at the historical archives of almost every Italian Jewish community archive, especially those of the major urban centres – Rome, Milan, Turin, Florence, Venice and Trieste. For these major centres, the principal Jewish institutions and archives are the CDEC Foundation; the Historical Archives of the Jewish Community of Rome (https://ascer.roma.it/); the Carlo and Vera Wagner Museum in Trieste; the Library Archive Renato Maestro in Venice (http://renatomaestro.org/it/); the Benvenuto and Umberto Terracini Archives in Turin (https://www.archivioterracini.it/patrimonio/archivi/); and the Historical Archives of the Jewish Community of Florence (https://www.firenzebraica.it/biblioteca-e-archivio/).\r\n\r\nThe National Museum of Italian Jewry and the Shoah [Museo Nazionale dell’Ebraismo Italiano e della Shoah, MEIS] in Ferrara as well as the Museum of the Shoah [Museo della Shoah] in Rome are under construction and they are still collecting material and documents, while the Memoriale della Shoah in Milan does not collect documents.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these two main categories of archival institutions, there is a third, more diverse group of private institutions that offer valuable documentation and information about the Holocaust in Italy. Notably, there is a network of 64 Institutes for the History of the Resistance Movement (Rete degli Istituti per la storia della Resistenza e dell’età contemporanea) spread across Italy and coordinated by the Istituto Nazionale Ferruccio Parri in Milan (formerly the Istituto Nazionale per la Storia del Movimento di Liberazione in Italia). The Archive of the Fondazione Memoria della Deportazione contains extensive materials and documentation on antifascist deportees. There are also numerous Catholic Parish and Diocesan archives. The Istituto Luce Cinecittà, the leading institute for audiovisual materials from the 1920s to the 1960s, holds a rich collection. The historical archives of the former Banca Commerciale Italiana, now part of the Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Group (with archival branches in Milan, Turin, Rome, and Bologna), contain a wealth of documentation related to the confiscation and restitution of Jewish assets, notably the Fondo EGELI (Ente di Gestione e Liquidazione Immobiliare). (https://asisp.intesasanpaolo.com/egeli/archive-fond/egeli). Since 2024, Intesa Sanpaolo's EGELI data have been available in Linked Open Data format at the following link: https://dati-asisp.intesasanpaolo.com/lod/resource/Dataset/BeniEbraici.html.\r\nAdditional documentation concerning EGELI is also available at the Fondazione 1563 Archive in Turin (https://archiviostorico.fondazione1563.it/oggetti/98550-iii-gestioni-egeli-ente-di-gestione-e-liquidazione-immobiliare-dell-istituto-di-san-paolo-di-torino/). Lastly, for insights into Jewish commercial and industrial activities in Italy, the historical archives of local Chambers of Commerce, one in each province, could prove useful.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI Identification and description of results**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Italy**\r\n\r\nAs a result of the identification process in Italy, EHRI has been able to provide descriptions for over 90 institutions. In particular, EHRI began with the identification of collections at the Central State Archives (ACS), local State Archives (AS), and the CDEC Foundation.\r\n\r\nIn general terms, the ACS collections hold documentation concerning the measures taken by the Fascist administration against the Jews while the material held by the local State Archives documents the practical implementation of such measures at the local level. At the Central State Archives, EHRI carried out identification work on the following six collections:\r\n- Ministero degli Interni [Ministry of Interior]\r\n- Ministero delle Finanze [Financial Ministry]\r\n- Ministero della Cultura Popolare [Ministry of Popular Culture]\r\n- Archivi fascisti [Fascist Archives]\r\n- EGELI – Ente Gestione e Liquidazione Immobiliare\r\n- Ministero per l’assistenza post-bellica [Ministry for Post-War Assistance]\r\n\r\nDescribing these collections provides an extensive and multifaceted overview of the material created by ministries and administrative bodies during the Fascist years and after the war. However, given the extent of these collections, the survey and the identification of Holocaust-related material at the ACS is far from complete.\r\n\r\nRegarding the local State Archives, the fonds “Questura” and “Prefettura” of each of the nearly 30 local State Archives which have collection descriptions have been found particularly relevant in documenting the various phases and measures taken by the Fascist regime against the Jews in Italy – Italian and foreigners – from 1938 to 1945.\r\n\r\nThe combination of documentation from the Central State Archives and local State Archives paints a rather detailed picture of how the administrative machine worked at both central and local levels. On the other hand, the documentation imported into the EHRI portal from Jewish institutions and archives – including the Union of the Italian Jewish Communities, several local Jewish Communities and the CDEC Foundation – provides perspectives of those persecuted by the Fascist regime and their reactions to such measures.\r\n\r\nThe CDEC Foundation’s collecting policies have focused on obtaining documentation linked to the persecution of the Jews and Jewish participation in the Resistance. Consequently, the Foundation’s materials focus on individuals and their testimonies about their psychological and physical suffering. From this perspective, the paper collections “Vicissitudini dei singoli”, “CRDE – Comitato Ricerche Deportati Ebrei” and “Massimo Adolfo Vitale” are particularly interesting, as is its photographic collection [“Collezione Fotografie Vittime della Shoah”], and its collection of audio and video interviews [“Testimonianze sulla Shoah”], which the CDEC has been recording since the early 1980s. In addition to the collections cited above, the documents created by the CDEC Foundation on the occasion of the trial (1964-1973) against Friedrich Boßhammer – the Nazi officer responsible for the mass deportation of Jews from Italy – also deserve a special mention. On that occasion, CDEC was in charge of collecting both direct survivor testimonies as well as documentation from several local State Archives in order to assist in the prosecution of Boßhammer. Most of this documentation is now gathered both in the collections “Processo Bosshammer” and “Collezione Archivi Italiani e stranieri”.\r\n\r\nApart from these main lines of inquiry, EHRI has also provided top and medium level descriptions from the Archives of the Union of the Italian Jewish Communities (UCEI) (http://archiviostorico.ucei.it/ucei-web/). The UCEI’s collections give a wide overview of the activities of the Italian Jewish leadership from the 1930s until the end of the war and the years afterward. Among other things these collections are particularly relevant from the point of view of the relationship between the Union and the Fascist government. Furthermore, it provides a rich corpus of documents regarding the measures of assistance towards Jewish refugees since the early 1930s.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Italy, material relevant to the Holocaust in Italy can be found in a number of institutions, including the German Bundesarchiv, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University, and Yad Vashem in Israel.",

                "history": "During the 1930s, Japan was characterized by the rise of extreme nationalism and a series of expansionist wars, beginning with the military take-over of northeastern China (Manchuria). After a military coup attempt in 1936, the Japanese military consolidated its control over the political system. In 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War began. Japan occupied large parts of Eastern China. Japan's stated war aim was to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, a vast pan-Asian union under Japanese domination. Japan, Germany and Italy formed the Tripartite Pact in September 1940, which is the basis for the Axis. On 7 December 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy launched a surprise attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This brought the US into the Second World War. Japan then successfully invaded the Asian colonies of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, having already penetrated French Indochina in 1940-1941. The tide began to turn against Japan following the Battle of Midway in June 1942. The Japanese military was responsible for war crimes against prisoners of war and civilians. On 6 August 1945, the US dropped an atomic bomb over Hiroshima. On 8/9 August, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and invaded Manchuria, and a day later Nagasaki was struck by a second atomic bomb. The unconditional surrender of Japan was communicated to the Allies on 14 August. \r\n\r\nWith a population of slightly over 70,000,000 in 1939, the Empire of Japan only had a small Jewish presence. The Russian Jewish community in Kobe was the largest (about 40 families in 1941). During the Second World War, Japan was initially regarded as a safe transit country and, for a limited number, a safe country of refuge, despite being an ally of Germany. Most of the German and Eastern European refugees were sent on to Shanghai in the Japanese-occupied part of China. Between 1938 and 1941, approximately 20,000 European Jewish refugees joined the city’s small population of Bagdadi and Russian Jews, and in 1943, were ordered by the Japanese authorities to relocate to one small section of the city.",
                "summary": "EHRI has identified the Diplomatic Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan and the Military History Office as holding Holocaust-relevant documents. The latter has sources pertaining to Jewish refugees and residents in areas occupied by Japan. However, EHRI is yet to determine the exact nature and significance of these collections. In the EHRI Portal, Japan is covered by several archival institutions, including USHMM, Yad Vashem and the Arolsen Archives.\r\n",

                "history": "The borders of what is now the present-day Kyrgyz Republic, or Kyrgyzstan, were first drawn up after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. After gaining some autonomy as the Kara-Kyrgyz Autonomous Oblast within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, it then became a Soviet Socialist Republic – the Kirghiz SSR – within the Soviet Union in 1936. During the German-Soviet War it served as one of the USSR’s main evacuation hubs. On 31 August 1991, Kyrgyzstan declared independence.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the German invasion, the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic had an estimated population of one million people. About 2,000 Jews lived in the Kirghiz SSR, most of whom were Ashkenazi who had arrived in the region following the establishment of the Soviet rule. Bukharan Jews lived mainly in the Southern cities of Osh and Jalalabad. They were part of the indigenous populations of Central Asia. In 1941/42, approximately ten to twenty thousand Jews arrived in Kyrgyzstan as evacuees, refugees or exiles. Most of them returned when the war ended, but a considerable number chose to stay. \r\n\r\nFor this country there are no sufficient findings on the history of Roma during the Second World War. EHRI would be pleased to receive any information. ",
                "summary": "EHRI has identified over fifteen archival institutions in Kyrgyzstan which hold Holocaust-related material. Four of them are located in the republic’s capital Bishkek. The most relevant archives for Holocaust research include the Central State Archive of the Kyrgyz Republic in Bishkek. Its collections include a fonds on the evacuation authority and personal registration evacuation cards, and various files dealing with the Polish government-in-exile. Similar files of a more local provenance are conserved by the regional archives, mainly in Osh, Kant and Tokmak.\r\n\r\nOutside of Kyrgyzstan, EHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections relevant for research on Kyrgyzstan.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Kyrgyzstan: Pre-existing research, available archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nFor a general overview of the Central Archive in Kyrgyzstan, which is available in Russian only, see:\r\n\r\nhttp://archive.kg\r\n\r\nThis site lists contacts to regional archives in Russian.\r\n\r\nThere is also a Kyrgyz web resource dedicated to the Second World War which contains many documents related to the role of the Kirghiz SSR in the war effort and the USSR’s evacuation policies (in Russian and Kyrgyz):\r\n\r\n https://pobeda.srs.kg\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Kyrgyz archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe majority of the central and regional Kyrgyz archives were founded during the pre-war Soviet period. Consequently, most of them are based on the Soviet system of cataloging and most of the inventory files are written in Russian to this day. There are other archival institutions that were established or restructured after Kyrgyzstan’s independence. The former Archive of the Communist Party of Kyrgyzstan was renamed the Central State Archive of Social-Political Documentation. It holds a considerable collection of decrees related to the evacuation, the war effort and the history of the Jews. As a result of regime changes and administrative reforms, some archival institutions in Kyrgyzstan have been renamed, which may cause some initial confusion among researchers.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Kyrgyzstan**\r\n\r\nIn Kyrgyzstan, EHRI identified over fifteen archival institutions which hold or may hold Holocaust-relevant material. Four of the most important of them are concentrated in the republic’s former capital, Bishkek. The Central State Archive alone stores some 4,000 fonds, and the regional archives of Osh, Tokmok and Jalal-Abad hold a similarly impressive number of collections. Given the scale of mass evacuation and escape to Kyrgyzstan during the Second World War, many Holocaust-relevant collections are either known to be stored or can be expected to be found in the country’s archives. \r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Kyrgyzstan, EHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections that may prove relevant to Holocaust research on Kyrgyzstan. For instance, the State Archives of the Russian Federation and the Russian State Archives of Socio-Political History (former Central Communist Party Archive) in Moscow hold records and circulars sent to various Socialist Republics and have a large fonds on evacuation. In Israel, Yad Vashem holds documentation from archives in Kyrgyzstan from 1930 to 1960 and the Archives of the History of the Jewish people in Jerusalem also hold a handful of collections related to this period. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum stores selected records from the Central State Archive of Kyrgyzstan.\r\n",

He was married to Elisabeth von Gutmann, a Jewish woman from Vienna, who was singled out by local Liechtenstein Nazis as the target of antisemitic propaganda. He was succeeded by Prince Franz Joseph II. During the Second World War, Liechtenstein officially remained neutral.\r\n\r\nLike many other countries, Liechtenstein tightened its immigration laws in 1938. Around 400 Jews sought refuge in Liechtenstein during the Holocaust. 235 were accepted, while 165 were turned back. 144 were allowed to become citizens in return for high fees. Liechtenstein had a total population of 10,800 in 1939.",

                "history": "Most of Lithuania had been a part of the Russian Empire until it declared independence in February 1918. The city of Klaipėda (Memel), occupied by Lithuanian troops in 1923, had to be handed back to the German Reich in March 1939. The secret additional protocol to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 assigned Lithuania to the German sphere of interest, recognising Lithuania’s interest in the Vilnius area, which had been a part of Poland since the end of the First World War. As a result, Vilnius and its surrounding area came under Lithuanian sovereignty in October 1939. Some five weeks later, the German-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation reassigned Lithuania to the Soviet sphere of influence, and on 15 June 1940 the Red Army entered Lithuania. One month later, the country was proclaimed a Soviet Republic. When German troops invaded the USSR on 22 June 1941, Lithuania passed under a German civilian administration and became a Generalbezirk of the Reichskommissariat Ostland. Lithuania was re-conquered by the Red Army from German rule between July 1944 and January 1945. Lithuania’s independence was re-proclaimed in 1990.\r\n\r\nIn 1939, Lithuania had a total population of some 2,900,000 people. On the eve of the German invasion, there were about 220,000 Jews among them, including approximately 80,000 Jews from the Vilnius area and some 15,000 Jewish refugees who had fled from the German-occupied western parts of Poland. Furthermore, among other refugees some 6,000 Jews left the Klaipėda region after March 1939. Immediately after the German invasion began, the Jews were attacked in pogroms. The systematic mass murder of Lithuania’s Jews began in the summer of 1941. By the end of 1941, nearly 180,000 Lithuanian Jews had been murdered. The remaining 40,000 Jews were mostly classified as fit for work and interned in four ghettos – Vilnius (18,000), Kaunas (16,000), Šiauliai (4,700) and Švenčionys (2,000) – or in forced labour camps. There were no mass murders in Lithuania in the period from early 1942 to mid-1943, but individual killings did occur. Then, in spring 1943, the Švenčionys and Ašmenos ghettos were liquidated and more than 4,000 inmates from both ghettos were murdered in Paneriai. During the autumn of 1943, the Vilnius ghetto was also liquidated. At the same time, the Kaunas and Šiauliai ghettos became concentration camps under the command of the SS. In the process, some 11,000 Jews from the Vilnius ghetto deemed capable of work were deported to concentration camps in Estonia and Latvia, while 3,500 women and children were sent to extermination camps in Poland. When the Germans retreated and liquidated the Kaunas ghetto in the summer of 1944, some 1,000 Jews were killed then and there, while approximately 6-7,000 were sent to Dachau and Stutthof. At the same time, a few thousand more were sent from Šiauliai to Stutthof. Overall, about 200,000 Lithuanian Jews perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nBefore World War II, about 1,500 Roma lived in Lithuania. This number does not cover the Vilnius region that was part of the Second Polish Republic until 1939. Under German occupation, Roma were killed in the local fields and forests, often without any official record. First mass killings took place along the Belarusian border in the early months of the occupation, intensifying in 1942. Further executions took place at the Pravieniškės forced labor camp near Kaunas in the summer of 1943 and between May and June 1944. Some Roma managed to flee from Pravieniškės during pit extraction works and joined the Soviet partisan movement in the north-west of Belarus.  At least 134 Roma were killed at the Paneriai mass extermination site near Vilnius in 1942 and in the spring of 1944. Many Roma were imprisoned in forced labour camps such as Pabradė, Ežerėlis, and Raudonplynė, and later hundreds were deported to Germany and occupied territories. Overall, at least 500 Lithuanian Roma were murdered during the Nazi occupation.",
                "summary": "Relying on pre-existing research and expert support in Lithuania, EHRI has identified over 10 archival institutions in the country which have Holocaust-related collections. A list is provided in the extensive report. EHRI has identified and described over 100 Holocaust-relevant collections in the Lithuanian Central State Archives alone. A somewhat smaller number of fonds have been found and described in other Lithuanian archival institutions. The Vilna Gaon  Museum of Jewish History has collections with Holocaust-relevant material. Such material may also be found at the Judaica Research Centre of the Martynas Mažvydas National Library of Lithuania as well as at the National Museum of Lithuania, M. K. Čiurlionis National Art Museum, Kaunas Ninth Fort Museum, Museum of Occupations and Freedom fights, Sugihara House Museum, Samogitian Museum Alka, and at Šiaulių Aušros Museum.\r\n\r\nEHRI identified a number of archival institutions outside of Lithuania, which hold or may hold collections relevant for Holocaust research on Lithuania. Vast collections on the Holocaust period in Lithuania can be found at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, the Yad Vashem archive, the Jewish Heritage Museum in NYC collections, the Ghetto Fighters' House Archives, Beit Hatfutsot: Museum of the Jewish People in Tel Aviv, and the National Library of Israel. Furthermore, the Belarusian State Archive-Museum of Literature and Art [Belarussskij Gosudarstvennyj Archiv-Muzej Literatury i Iskusstva], the State Archive of the Russian Federation [Gosudarstvennij Archiv Rossijskoj Federacii, GARF] hold collections on Lithuania which may be relevant to Holocaust research, but EHRI has yet to explore their exact nature and importance.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Lithuania: Pre-existing research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nEHRI’s exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in Lithuania could rely on some important pre-existing research in the field, such as Christoph Dieckmann’s *Deutsche Besatzungspolitik in Litauen 1941-1944* (2011), which makes extensive use of archival material available in the country. EHRI also worked closely with the Vilna Gaon Museum of Jewish History in Vilnius, which became a consortium partner during EHRI’s second phase. Thanks to the support of this institution, EHRI has been able to identify important collections in over ten different institutions. There is one helpful archival guide on Holocaust-relevant sources in the Lithuanian Central State Archive, which is written in both Lithuanian and English:\r\n\r\n- [2011] Žirikova, Galina, *Lietuvos centrinio valstybės archyvo fondai: holokausto Lietuvoje tyrimo šaltinis* (*The Collections of the State Archive of Lithuania: a Source of Research on the Holocaust in Lithuania*), Vilnius: Valstybinis Vilniaus Gaono Žydų Muziejus, 2011.\r\n\r\nLitvakSIG (Lithuanian-Jewish Special Interest Group) is the primary internet resource for Lithuanian-Jewish (Litvak) genealogy research worldwide. All the data is available via the All Lithuania Database, a freely searchable database which has more than 2,500,000 records transcribed and translated from various archival institutions in Lithuania and abroad:\r\n- https://www.litvaksig.org/\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Lithuania’s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAn important number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created or are deposited in Lithuania and can still be found in the country’s archives today. The Chief Archivist’s Office allows free access to all fonds. Some restrictions may apply to files containing personal data, but even these can be used either by relatives of the persons named in such files, or for academic survey purposes after applying for a special permission to the archive’s director. Restricted source material cannot be published.\r\n\r\nOn a practical level, a working knowledge of Lithuanian and/or Russian is helpful for any kind of archival research in Lithuania, even though documents in other languages can also be found with the help of the local archival staff. Beyond that, archives in Lithuania offer a wide range of research tools, ranging from traditional card index catalogues to electronic catalogues. The digitalisation of file and fonds descriptions is in progress in most archives.\r\n\r\nConcerning Holocaust research, finding relevant documents can be difficult due to a certain lack of accuracy in available collection descriptions. EHRI’s expert on Lithuania estimates that only some 15% of all relevant descriptions actually contain the word \"Holocaust\", while the other 85%, which are potentially equally important, remain obscured. For instance, fonds on the Vilnius, Kaunas and Šiaulai ghettos are rather easy to find, while sources on the provincial regions of Lithuania are harder to come by. On the other hand, the Lithuanian Special Archives’ reading room offers an electronic register of participants in the Holocaust, such as Kaunas policemen in 1941/42. The names of participants and bystanders can be found, for instance, in survivor’s testimonies at the Lithuanian Central Archives. In the light of these findings, EHRI has made considerable headway in identifying and describing Holocaust-relevant collections in Lithuania, but the full potential of the country’s archival institutions remains to be determined. A survey of the collections held by small local museums in Lithuania, of private collections and of surviving photographs from the Holocaust period, is highly desirable.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Lithuania**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Lithuania**\r\n\r\nIn Lithuania, EHRI has identified over 10 archival institutions which hold Holocaust-related collections. Most of them are concentrated in the country’s capital, Vilnius. At the Lithuanian Central State Archives alone, EHRI has identified and described over 160 Holocaust-relevant collections, which contain, among others, sources produced by German District and Police Chiefs, various municipalities and prison administrations. At the other five Vilnius-based institutions, over 160 additional Holocaust-relevant collections have been identified and described so far. The Lithuanian Special Archives, for instance, contain the cases and trials of collaborators who persecuted Jews in Lithuania. The Vilna Gaon Museum of Jewish History, to which the Lithuanian Central State Archive has re-transferred a former collection in 1998 (parts of the LCVA fonds RG 1390 was catalogued under call number VŽM at the Museum) keeps records about Jews murdered in various Lithuanian cities, as well as relevant copied source material from archives in neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified a number of archival institutions outside of Lithuania, which hold or may hold collections relevant for Holocaust research on Lithuania. Vast collections on the Holocaust period in Lithuania can be found at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, Yad Vashem, the Jewish Heritage Museum in NYC collections, the Ghetto Fighters' House Archives, Beit Hatfutsot: Museum of the Jewish People in Tel Aviv, and the National Library of Israel. Furthermore the Belarusian State Archive-Museum of Literature and Art [Belarussskij Gosudarstvennyj Archiv-Muzej Literatury i Iskusstva] and the State Archive of the Russian Federation [Gosudarstvennij Archiv Rossijskoj Federacii, GARF] hold collections on Lithuania which may be relevant to Holocaust research, but EHRI has yet to explore their exact nature and importance.",

                "history": "The Germans invaded Luxembourg on 10 May 1940 and immediately set up a military administration. The Grand Duchess of Luxembourg and her government fled to France and Portugal and, eventually, to Great Britain. In August 1940, a German civilian government was established under the leadership of the adjoining German Gau of Koblenz-Trier (from January 1941 Gau Moselland). In August 1942, Germany introduced compulsory military service for young Luxembourgers and bestowed German citizenship on collaborators (measures which caused a general strike in the country). The country was liberated by the Allies on 9 September 1944.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War, Luxembourg had a total population of some 300,000 inhabitants. Around 3,900 of them were Jews. Most were refugees who had arrived since Hitler's rise to power in 1933. From September 1940 to October 1941, approximately 3,000 Jews left Luxembourg, seeking refuge in France or Belgium. Some 700 were able to leave the German-controlled countries of Europe. By October 1941, most of the remaining Jews were old, poor or sick. In September 1940, the administration applied the Nuremberg Laws to Luxembourg and began to confiscate Jewish property. In July 1941, the Jews of Luxembourg were ordered to wear a yellow armband on their left arm and in October 1941 the Jewish badge. Many were placed in a ghetto-like camp, which soon became the assembly point in Luxembourg for deportations to the east. That same month, the deportations began; on 16 October, 322 Jews were sent to the ghetto of Litzmannstadt . Overall, 662 Jews were deported in seven transports, the last of which left in June 1943. Only 45 are known to have survived. Many were sent directly to extermination camps (Auschwitz) or passed through Theresienstadt. Of the 3,900 Jews who lived in Luxembourg before the war, 1,200 perished.\r\n\r\nSince the early 18th century, a very small group of Sinti and Roma lived in Luxembourg. The Grand Duchy systematically prevented members of the minority from entering the country, so that only a few families were living there at the beginning of the Second World War. In recent research, the names of just over 20 Sinti and Roma who were deported from German-occupied Luxembourg or as Luxembourg nationals and some of whom were murdered were identified.",
                "summary": "EHRI was able to establish that Holocaust-related collections are held by the National Archives. They include material generated by Luxembourg’s administration (both at home and in exile), the German occupation authorities, financial agencies, Jewish bodies and post-war investigations. The National Archives have also acquired the collections of the Centre de Documentation et de Recherche sur la Résistance, which closed in 2016. The archives of the City of Luxembourg possess some files related to the synagogue and its destruction. The local archives of Grevenmacher, Mondorf, Esch/Alzette, Differdange, Dudelange and Ettelbruck may keep some files pertaining to the Jewish communities that lived in these towns before the German occupation of Luxembourg. The local archives of Wintger keep a card file of Jews imprisoned in the small ghetto of Fünfbrunnen [Cinqfontaines] before their deportation. EHRI was able to identify two helpful archival guides which are listed in the extensive report.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Luxembourg: Pre-existing Research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nUntil recently Holocaust remained under-researched in Luxembourg, which was in part due to the fact that the country did not have its own university before 2003. Until then, academic research depended mainly on private endeavours undertaken abroad. Since the establishment of the university, two Holocaust-relevant conferences have taken place in Luxembourg, the results of which will be published shortly. Moreover, the Université de Luxembourg’s history department has launched a project to interview contemporary witnesses of the Second World War, which may lead to a number of Holocaust survivor testimonies. Furthermore, there is an exhibition catalogue on the “Exilland Luxemburg 1933-1947”, which deals with, among other things, racial refugees from Germany brought to Luxembourg during the 1930s, and resulted in the publication of Hugo Heumann’s memoirs, *Erlebtes und Erlittenes. Von Mönchengladbach über Luxemburg nach Theresienstadt. Tagebuch eines deutsch-jüdischen Emigranten* (2007). A catalogue on another exhibition shown in the Musée national de la Résistance under the title “Between Shade and Darkness. Le sort des Juifs du Luxembourg de 1940 à 1945” was reprinted in 2016. There is also a recent, albeit non-academic, publication on the Jews of Luxembourg, published by Laurent Moyse: *Du rejet à l’intégration. Histoire des Juifs du Luxembourg des origines à nos jours* (2011).\r\n\r\nWorking with the Centre de Documentation et Recherche sur la Résistance (which has since closed) and the contemporary history section of the National Archives of Luxembourg, EHRI’s on-site surveys identified key archival institutions and two helpful archival guides :\r\n\r\n- [2003/1995] Spang, Paul, *Etat général des fonds conservés aux Archives nationales du Grand Duché de Luxembourg et aux archives de la Section historique de l’Institut grand-ducal* (Luxembourg, Publications de la Section historique de l'Institut grand-ducal, vol. 112-113: tome 1 1995, tome 2 2003)\r\n\r\n- [1978] *Grand-Duché de Luxembourg: Archives de l'Etat. Inventaire détaillé des affiches de la deuxième guerre mondiale* (Luxembourg: Ministère des affaires culturelles, 1978)\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Luxembourg archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe main archives are the National Archives located in Luxembourg City. A law on the archives was passed in 2018. In general, access is granted to documents older than 30 years. The files originating from the Prosecutor General’s Office are only accessible with a special permission from the Prosecutor General. Luxembourg also has private archives. Holocaust-related collections held by the National Archives include material generated by Luxembourg’s administration (both at home and in exile), the German occupation authorities, financial agencies, Jewish bodies and post-war investigations. The National Archives have also acquired the collections of the Centre de Documentation et de Recherche sur la Résistance when it closed in 2016. The archives of the city of Luxembourg possess some files related to the synagogue and its destruction. The local archives of Grevenmacher, Mondorf, Esch/Alzette, Differdange, Dudelange, Ettelbruck, towns where Jewish communities existed before the German occupation of Luxembourg, may keep some files pertaining to these communities. The local archives of Wintger keep a card file of those Jews imprisoned in the small ghetto of Fünfbrunnen [Cinqfontaines] before their deportation.\r\n\r\n**C.

                "history": "Latvia had been part of the Russian Empire until the country declared independence on 18 November 1918. The secret additional protocol to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 assigned Latvia to the Soviet sphere of interest, and in June 1940, the Red Army entered Latvian territory. One month later, Latvia was proclaimed a Soviet Republic. By 10 July 1941, weeks after the German attack on the USSR, all of Latvia was under German occupation. Latvia was subjected to a German civilian administration as Generalbezirk Lettland of the Reichskommissariat Ostland. The Red Army began re-conquering Latvia in the summer of 1944, and reached the country’s capital, Riga, in October 1944. The westernmost parts of Latvia were reclaimed by the Soviet Union only in May 1945. Latvia’s independence was restored on 4 May 1990.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Latvia had a total population of 1,995,000 people, including some 92,000 Jews. Almost half of them lived in Riga, but there were also large communities in Daugavpils and Liepaja. During the Soviet occupation, about 1,800 Jews were deported to Siberia by the Soviet secret police. When the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 and pushed through Latvia, only about 14,500 to 15,000 Jews managed to escape eastwards. \r\nAround 75,000 Jews remained in Latvia under German occupation. German attacks on the Jews quickly escalated to mass murder. Most of the Latvian Jews who lived outside the main urban centres were murdered in July and August 1941. Between August and December 1941, the majority of the inmates of the Daugavpils and Riga Ghettos were murdered. By 1 January 1942, only some 9,000 Jews were still alive, mainly in the ghettos of Riga and Daugavpils, but also in Liepaja, where the ghetto had only been established in July 1942, or in concentration camps. About 25,000 Jews from Central Europe (mostly from Germany, Austria and Bohemia) were deported to the Riga ghetto. By 1943 most of the Jews on Latvian territory were dead. Survivors of the Riga ghetto were first sent to the Kaiserwald concentration camp and then transferred to Stutthof in September 1944. Overall, about 74,000 Latvian Jews perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nAccording to a census conducted in 1935, 3,839 Roma lived in Latvia. The German occupiers' policy towards Roma left those responsible a great deal of leeway, which led to murders, but also to sparing from persecution. The first murder took place on 5 December 1941, when the German security police shot 100 Roma from Liepāja (German Libau). More than a dozen shootings of Roma are known to have taken place in 1942 and 1943; in Jelgava (German Mitau) alone, 810 Roma were shot. Overall, half of all Roma living in Latvia were murdered by the German security and police forces, as well as local auxiliary forces. ",
                "summary": "EHRI has identified seven archival institutions in Latvia, all of them concentrated in Riga. A full list can be found in the extensive report. While all of them store Holocaust-related collections, a local team of experts was able to provide EHRI with a tailor-made collection descriptions for the important Holocaust-related holdings of the State Historical Archives of Latvia, the State Archives of Latvia and the Latvia State Archive of Audiovisual Documents.\r\n\r\nOutside of Latvia, sources relevant to Holocaust research on Latvia can be found, among other institutions, at the Bundesarchiv, Yad Vashem, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Latvia: Pre-existing research, archival guides and expert support**\r\n\r\nEHRI’s exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in Latvia could rely on some important pre-existing research in the field, such as Katrin Reichelt’s *Lettland unter deutscher Besatzung 41-1944. Der lettische Anteil am Holocaust* (2011), and Andrej Angrick’s and Peter Klein’s *The Final Solution in Riga: Exploitation and Annihilation, 1941-1944* (2009).\r\n\r\nWorking extensively with the National Archives of Latvia, EHRI was able to identify important collections in three Riga-based archives: the National Archives of Latvia, State Historical Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacionālā arhīva Latvijas Valsts vēstures arhīvs, LNA LVVA]; the National Archives of Latvia, State Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacionālā arhīva Latvijas Valst arhīvs, LNA LVA]; and the Latvia State Archive of Audiovisual Documents [Latvijas Valsts kinofotofonodokumentu arhivs]. \r\n\r\nAn overview of Latvian State Archives, which is written in both Latvian and English and available in print and online, suggests that there are more Holocaust-relevant archives to discover, especially among the eleven Regional State Archives:\r\n\r\n- [2004] Bušmane, Inta/Maija Āboltin̦a (ed.), *Valsts arhīvi Latvijā / Latvia state archives* (Riga: Latvijas Valsts arhīvu g̕enerāldirekcija : \"Mantojums\", [2004]), (http://www.arhivi.lv/sitedata/VAS/Arhivu%20vesture/Latvijas%20valsts%20arhivi.pdf)\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Latvia’s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAn important number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created or have been deposited in Latvia and can still be found in the country’s archives today. Access to them appears to be unrestricted, but some limits to the use of personal data are to be expected. The most frequent languages of the sources are German, Russian and Latvian. On a practical level, a working knowledge of Latvian and/or Russian is probably necessary for any kind of archival research in Latvia, even though documents in other languages can also be found with the help of the local archival staff.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Latvia**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Latvia**\r\n\r\nHolocaust-relevant sources in Latvia are concentrated in the country’s capital, Riga and in two archives in particular:\r\n\r\n- the National Archives of Latvia, State Historical Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacionālā arhīva Latvijas Valsts vēstures arhīvs, LNA LVVA], which keeps mostly documents from the period until 1944, and\r\n\r\n- the National Archives of Latvia, State Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacionālā arhīva Latvijas Valst arhīvs, LNA LVA], which keep documents from the period since 1945.\r\n\r\nAt the State Historical Archives alone, EHRI has identified and described over 50 Holocaust-related fonds, some of which contain thousands of files pertaining to all of Latvia or to certain regions, districts and cities. The fonds identified and described by EHRI include collections of sources produced by German occupation and administrative authorities, such as the Reichskommissar Ostland or the SS and Police Leader in Latvia, but also ample sources left by local Latvian institutions, e.g. very extensive District Police records. The sources for the survey consisted of the, mostly printed, finding aids available at the archives. For example, the fonds of the Commissar General in Riga contains seven finding aids that describe the German records in Latvian. These handwritten and typed finding aids are available at the reading room.\r\n\r\nAt the State Archives of Latvia, EHRI has identified three important Holocaust-related fonds of Soviet origin, which contain material on war crimes investigations in Latvia. The identification and investigation work on these two fonds was carried out by local experts. Most of the work consisted of document analysis and research on previously undescribed archive fonds no. 1986. The work included reviewing the fonds card index (93,608 cards) and 26 record registration journals. As this fonds had no description, it was necessary to compare the data in the card index with the data in the registration journals to find certain criminal cases (persons convicted or judged). These criminal cases are usually several volumes long. To find all information about the Holocaust victims, one would have to examine all 52,653 records. The survey team looked through the criminal cases which consisted of a large number volumes, such as the files of Victor Arājs (1910-1988) and Boļeslavs Maikovskis (1904-1996). The former was the Chief of the Arājs Command who committed mass executions of Jews for the German Security Police. Arājs was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1979 by a Hamburg court. Boleslavs Maikovskis was a Latvian who served as chief of police for the second precinct of Rēzekne during the German occupation of Latvia in the Second World War. Maikovskis was tried under the German court system in 1988, but by 1994 was deemed too frail to continue the trial. Together, these cases are enclosed in dozens of volumes. Approximately 90% of the KGB documents are in Russian.\r\n\r\nEHRI has also added collection descriptions of sources held by the Latvia State Archive of Audiovisual Documents [Latvijas Valsts kinofotofonodokumentu arhivs].\r\n\r\nIn addition to the three archives named above, EHRI has identified four more institutions in Riga which hold Holocaust-relevant material on Latvia:\r\n\r\n- the Museum “Jews in Latvia” [Muzejs “Ebreji Latvijā],\r\n\r\n- the Museum of the Occupation of Latvia 1940-1991 [Latvijas Okupācijas muzejs],\r\n\r\n- the Riga Ghetto and Latvian Holocaust Museum [Rīga geto un Latvijas Holokausta muzejs].\r\n\r\n- National Archives of Latvia - State Archives of Personnel Documents [Latvijas Nacionālais arhīvs - Personāla dokumentu valsts arhīvs]\r\n\r\nThe repository descriptions for these institutions provide researchers with general information on the materials that can be found here.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Latvia, sources relevant to Holocaust research on Latvia can be found at Yad Vashem, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies and other locations.\r\n",

                "history": "Until 1918, Bessarabia (most of which is part of Moldova today) was part of the Russian Empire. Before the Second World War, most of present-day Moldova was part of the Romanian region of Bessarabia, while a slim strip of land east of the Dniester River was part of the Moldavian Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic (MASSR) within Soviet Ukraine. According to the secret addenda to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939, Bessarabia was, among other regions, assigned to the Soviet zone of influence. On 28 June 1940, Romania was forced to hand over Bessarabia to the Soviet Union. The new Moldavian Socialist Soviet Republic (MSSR) within the USSR was formed on 2 August 1940 mostly from six counties of formerly Romanian Bessarabia and six raions (regions) of the former MASSR. After the German attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Germany's ally Romania regained its former region of Bessarabia until the Red Army recaptured these territories on 24 August 1944. The recaptured territories thus remained within the USSR as one of the union republics (MSSR) until 1991. When the Soviet Union dissolved, the Republic of Moldova declared independence in 1991.\r\n\r\nIn 1940, the territories of today’s Moldova had an estimated total population of 2,468,000 people. Some 270,000 to 280,000 of them were Jews. The Soviets deported about 8,000 Jews as “class-hostile elements” to remote areas of the USSR and tens of thousands of Jews managed to escape or were evacuated to the east when the German-Romanian invasion began in July 1941. Romanian and German units began the mass extermination of the Moldovan Jews. The surviving Jews were deported to Transnistria, the area between the Dnister and Bug rivers and around Odessa given over to Romanian occupation. Thousands died in the process or later on in transit camps. Once there, some were killed in mass shootings, but many more died from disease, hunger and overwork in the ghettos and camps. Most of the Jews in the Moldovan districts in Transnistria perished in a similar fashion. Some relief sent by Romanian Jewish aid organizations reached the survivors of the deportations after the Romanian dictator Antonescu stopped his policies of extermination in 1942/1943. Overall, around 150,000 Jews from Moldova perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nRoma lived in the region of Moldova for centuries where they were subject to enslavement until the mid-nineteenth century. The exact number of Roma living in the territory of present-day Moldova during the Second World War is not known. Around 2,200 Roma were deported from Bessarabia to Transnistria in the autumn of 1942. How many of them survived is also not known. ",
                "summary": "The majority of Moldova's Holocaust-related collections is concentrated in the National Archive of the Republic of Moldova and the Special State Repository of the Intelligence and Security Service. The majority of NARM’s Holocaust-related collections has been described by EHRI. Outside of Moldova, EHRI was able to identify important Holocaust-relevant collections at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM), which has numerous microfilmed records from the NARM, People’s Commissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVD) war crimes investigation and trial documents, as well as dozens of oral history interviews from Moldova. More Holocaust-relevant material on Moldova can also be found at Yad Vashem, which holds legal documentation from Moldovan KGB archives and, to a lesser extent, at the state archives of Odessa and Mykolaiv Oblasts in Odessa, Ukraine.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Moldova: Pre-existing research, available archival guides and expert support**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Moldova, EHRI could rely on a number of pre-existing works on the Holocaust in Romania, as well as a number of works specifically devoted to the Holocaust in Bessarabia and Transnistria. These works include the following monographs: Jean Ancel, *Documents Concerning the Fate of the Romanian Jewry during the Holocaust*, 12 vols. (New York: Beate Klarsfeld Foundation, 1986); Jean Ancel, *Transnistria, 1941-1942*, 3 vols. (Tel Aviv: The Goldstein-Goren Diaspora Research Center, 2003); Radu Ioanid, *The Holocaust in Romania: The Destruction of Jews and Gypsies Under the Antonescu Regime, 1940-1944* (Ivan R. Dee, 2008); Dennis Deletant, *Hitler's Forgotten Ally: Ion Antonescu and his Regime, Romania 1940-1944* (Springer, 2006); Diana Dumitru, *The State, Antisemitism, and Collaboration in the Holocaust: The Borderlands of Romania and the Soviet Union* (Cambridge University Press, 2016); Vladimir Solonari, *Purifying the Nation: Population Exchange and Ethnic Cleansing in Nazi-Allied Romania* (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009). EHRI has also relied on third parties that had previously carried out survey and copying work, such as the USHMM and Yad Vashem. \r\n\r\nEHRI did not identify finding aids specifically devoted to archival documents regarding wartime Bessarabia and Transnistria, but instead relied on available finding aids for different archives in Moldova. Four archival aids must be mentioned in particular: \r\n\r\n- *Tsentral'nyy Gosudarstvennyy Arkhiv Moldavskoy SSR i yego filial v g. Tiraspole, kratkiy spravochnik* [Central State Archive of the Moldavian SSR and its branch in Tiraspol, a brief finding aid] (Kishinev: \"Shtiintsa\", 1988)\r\n\r\n- *Îndrumătorul Arhivei Naţionale a Republicii Moldova (partea II-a, 1918 – începutul secolului XXI*, ediţia a II-a, revăzută şi completată) [The Guide of the National Archive of the Republic of Moldova (Part II, 1918 - beginning of XXI century, second edition, revised and supplemented)] (Chişinău, 2012)\r\n\r\n- *Arhiva Organizaţiilor Social-Politice a Republicii Moldova. Îndrumător* [Archives of the Social-Political Organizations of the Republic of Moldova. Finding aid] (Chişinău, 2008)\r\n\r\n- *Tsentral'nyy Gosudarstvennyy Arkhiv Pridnestrovskoy Moldavskoy Respubliki. Putevoditel’* [Central State Archive of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic. Finding aid] (Tiraspol', 2010)\r\n\r\nRelying on these finding aids, EHRI identified relevant archival fonds, compared archival holdings in Moldova with the archival holdings copied from Moldovan archives by the USHMM and Yad Vashem, and introduced both to the EHRI database.\r\n\r\nEHRI established contact with the director of the National Archives of the Republic of Moldova (NARM) in order to facilitate access to the Holocaust-relevant archival sources for EHRI Moldova country experts. Taking into account that a number of highly relevant documents are still stored at the Special State Repository of the Intelligence and Security Service (SIS), which regularly does not provide access to researchers, the full extent and importance of Holocaust-related documents held in Moldova is yet to be determined.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Moldova's archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nMoldova exhibits a highly centralized archival system and its administration, the State Archival Agency (Agenția Națională a Arhivelor) is in charge of the State archival system. The state archives are made up of two major archives in Chisinau and multiple regional and departmental archives. For a guide to the Moldova's archival system and its history see Mihai Taşcă et al., Ghidul arhivelor din Republica Moldova [Guidebook for the Archives in the Republic of Moldova] (Chișinău: Pontos, 2011). Prewar archival documents of Bessarabia and MASSR are stored in the NARM due to centralization effort during the 1950s. \r\n\r\nThe main challenge regarding research in Moldova's archives is the accessibility of data. Some documents of the archival fonds remain partially closed to the public. In NARM and the Archives of Socio-Political Organizations of the Republic of Moldova [AOSP, Arhiva Organizaţiilor Social-Politice ale Republicii Moldova] accessibility to inventories remains a challenge as the latter are only partially available in the reading rooms and must be requested separately. Access to thematic catalogues and the provision of advice and guidance to researchers are also often problematic. The archives in Moldova have only very recently started to digitise their collections.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Moldova**\r\n\r\n**C.I In Moldova**\r\n\r\nIn Moldova, EHRI has identified several archival institutions which hold or may hold Holocaust-relevant documents on Bessarabia and Transnistria. For these institutions, EHRI has made over 150 Holocaust-relevant archival descriptions available. In the NARM, EHRI identified documents on the prewar Jewish life and education, as well as wartime documents issued by the Romanian authorities related to administration of Bessarabia and Transnistria Governorate: directorates, town administrations [primaria], county administrations [prefectura] and district administrations [pretura], files of the gendarmery, corps of the Romanian army, police, tribunals, financial administration, chambers of commerce and industry, religious administration et altc. In the AOSP and Central State Archive of the (unrecognised) Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic [Tsentral'nyy Gosudarstvennyy Arkhiv Pridnestrovskoy Moldavskoy Respubliki], EHRI identified documents of the post-war Soviet authorities that mainly relate to the effort to assess the damage and human losses caused by the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n**C.II In other countries**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections outside of Moldova that are relevant to Holocaust research. Primarily, these are Holocaust-relevant collections at the USHMM, which has numerous microfilmed records from the NARM, as well as People’s Commissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVD) war crimes investigation and trial documents, and dozens of oral history interviews from Moldova. EHRI identified and introduced files to the database that are stored at the NARM, but are not mentioned in the NARM finding aid. Copies of these files, however, are available in the USHMM, including the files of the Republican Board of the Moldovan SSR to promote the activity of the emergency state commission for the investigation of crimes committed by German-Fascist invaders (1943-1947). In Israel, at Yad Vashem, EHRI identified war crimes investigation and trial records copied from the Special State Repository of the Intelligence and Security Service.\r\n\r\n",

                "history": "In 1918, what is now North Macedonia became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. After the German conquest of Yugoslavia in April 1941, North Macedonia was divided between the occupying forces of Germany (in the north), Bulgaria (in the centre and east), and Italian-controlled Albania (in the west). After Italy’s capitulation in September 1943, a portion of western Vardar Macedonia briefly came under partisan control before German forces captured the territory. In September 1944, the Germans attempted to establish an Independent State of Macedonia, but without substantial military support, it ceased to exist in November 1944. Shortly afterwards, North Macedonia was declared a state-member of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia (FNRJ), later the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). In 1991, it declared independence as the Republic of Macedonia. In 2019, it was renamed North Macedonia. \r\n\r\nBefore the Second World War, approximately 12,000 Jews lived in North Macedonia. Towards the end of 1941, authorities in the Bulgarian-occupied territories passed laws prohibiting Jews from engaging in commerce. In 1943, the Bulgarians deported thousands of Jews from the regions they controlled in North Macedonia (and Greece) at the behest of the Germans. Once they were handed over to the Nazi German authorities, they were taken to Treblinka II where they were murdered in the gas chambers upon their arrival. 7,144 Jews from North Macedonia perished in this way. After the war, there were approximately 200 surviving Jews left in North Macedonia.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War, in the area of today's North Macedonia lived the largest Roma community in Yugoslavia (officially about 24,000). Roma worked as craftsmen and traders and were of Muslim or Orthodox faith. The occupying authorities - Bulgaria and Albania under Italian control and from September 1944 Germany alone - did not implement a genocidal policy towards the Roma, but there are cases of mass crimes committed against them. Roma were also used as forced labourers. The Bulgarian occupation authorities legally discriminated against Roma, preventing them from marrying non-Roma. Part of the Roma escaped the violence and persecution by fleeing into the forests and joining the anti-fascist partisan resistance movement.",

Characteristics of the North Macedonian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe State Archives of the Republic of North Macedonia are organised as an independent official administration body for performing archival activity throughout the entire state of North Macedonia. The State Archives manage a network of nine regional archives, which are located in Bitola, Kumanovo, Ohrid, Prilip, Skopje, Strumica, Tetovo, Titov Veles, and Štip. Each archive functions as a separate department, оr as a dislocated organisational unit, of the State Archives and performs archival functions within a particular region of North Macedonia.\r\n\r\nThere are also Holocaust-relevant archives that function outside of the network of the State Archives, including the Archives of the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts (MASA) and the Archives of the Jewish Community in the Republic of Macedonia. The role of the MASA Archives is to collect, house, process, protect and make available archival materials produced by scientific, scholarly and artistic institutions, by the Academy or its individual members or by other individuals whose work is relevant to the sciences and arts in North Macedonia. As for the Archives of the Jewish Community, these were formed in the wake of the Second World War and they hold significant material from the period preceding and after the Holocaust.\r\n\r\n**C.

The Dutch army surrendered four days later, and Queen Wilhelmina fled to Great Britain, where she set up a government-in-exile. The heads of the government ministries stayed behind, forming a substitute cabinet. Hitler soon ordered the establishment of a German civilian administration, led by Reich Commissioner Arthur Seyss-Inquart. The Allies entered the south of the country in the autumn of 1944; the north was liberated more than six months later, in the spring of 1945.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the occupation, the Netherlands had a total population of about 9 million inhabitants. About 160,000 of them were Jewish, roughly half of which lived in Amsterdam. Some 22,000, including 15,000 refugees from Germany and Austria, were of foreign nationality. In the autumn of 1940, a series of anti-Jewish measures began. In mid-February 1941, the German occupier set up a Jewish Council [“Joodse Raad”]. On 25 February 1941, a general strike broke out to protest against the German occupier. In January 1942 the Germans opened forced labour camps, and charged the Joodse Raad with finding workers to fill ever-increasing labour quotas. The same month they began removing the Jews from the provinces and concentrating them in Amsterdam. In March, the German administration started confiscating Jewish property. A month later the Jews were ordered to wear the yellow Star of David. Deportations began in mid-July 1942 and lasted through September 1944. Jews were taken to the transit camps Westerbork and Vught, and from there mostly to Auschwitz. While some 25,000 Dutch Jews managed to go into hiding after being ordered to report for forced labour or deportation, about one-third of them were eventually discovered by the Germans. All in all, less than 25 percent of Dutch Jewry survived the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nSinti have lived in the Netherlands since the Middle Ages, while Roma arrived in the early 19th century. In the 1930 census, some 11,000 ‘travellers’ were registered, only a few hundred of whom were Sinti or Roma. Under German occupation, strict measures against \"woonwagenbewoners\" were carried out and some collection camps were installed. During a nationwide round-up on 16 May 1944, 578 Sinti, Roma and travellers were interned in Westerbork camp. After a selection, 245 Sinti and Roma were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Only 31 of them survived the war.",

Furthermore, EHRI identified a number of Holocaust-relevant research tools, including important online resources, but also traditional archival guides. For a full list, see the extensive report.\r\n\r\nNIOD was founded immediately after the war under the name of National Institute for War Documentation [Rijksinstituut voor Oorlogsdocumentatie, RIOD], under the auspices of the Ministry of Education, Culture & Science. In 1999 it was placed under the authority of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW). It holds important Holocaust collections, such as the archives of the German occupational administration, of the Joodse Raad and of several camps (especially Westerbork). Apart from official documentation, NIOD’s collection also includes private sources, such as journals, correspondence and pictures. A joint effort of the National Archive and NIOD led to the creation of a website on Dutch WWII archival sources, [Wegwijzer Archieven WOII](http://www.archievenwo2.nl/). A thematic query on “persecution of the Jews” [“Jodenvervolging”] leads to 773 archival collections in 142 archival institutions. These cover a broad variety of institutions, national as well as local and specialised institutions. There are also private archives and documentation centres, such as the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam, which hold important Holocaust-related collections.",

Notably, the national “Heritage of War Programme” (2005-2009) intended to preserve the memories about the war for future generations, provided EHRI with a solid starting point. Existing descriptions have also been taken from the database behind the website on Dutch WWII archival sources. In a few cases, more detailed descriptions have been taken directly from the institutions themselves, such as NIOD and the Amsterdam City Archives.\r\n\r\nEHRI was able to identify a number of helpful archival guides, both online and offline:\r\n\r\n- http://www.archievenwo2.nl\r\n\r\nThis site unifies information on archives and collections on National-Socialism and the Second World War concerning the Netherlands, the Dutch East Indies, Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles. It is available in Dutch only and does not display archival documents, but serves as a search tool to locate archives and collections.\r\n\r\n- http://www.kamparchieven.nl\r\n\r\nThis site offers a survey of archives and collections of the German camps that existed in the Netherlands during the Second World War (Amersfoort, Vught, Westerbork, Schoorl en Ommen). It is available in Dutch and English and is an initiative of the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies in collaboration with several other institutions (War Aftercare Department of the Netherlands Red Cross; Eemland Archive; Brabant Historical Information Centre (BHIC); Drenthe Archive; Midden-Drenthe Municipality Archive; Memorial Centre Camp Westerbork; National Monument Camp Amersfoort; National Monument Camp Vught; Regional Archive Alkmaar).\r\n\r\n- http://www.oorlogsgetroffenen.nl\r\n\r\nThis site unifies information on archives and collections from organizations involved in tracing, repatriating and sheltering victims of the Second World War in the aftermath of the conflict. It is available in Dutch only.\r\n\r\n- http://www.beeldbankwo2.nl\r\n\r\nThis database brings together all the images of the Second World War that can be found in the collections of Dutch war and resistance museums, commemoration centres and NIOD. Anyone can view and order the images.\r\nThe following traditional archival guides identified by EHRI also deserve to be mentioned:\r\n\r\n- [1998] J.M.L. van Bockxmeer, P.C.A. Lamboo en H.A.J. van Schie, *Onderzoeksgids Joodse oorlogsgetroffenen; overzicht van archieven met gegevens over roof, recuperatie, rechtsherstel en schadevergoeding van vermogens van Joden in Nederland in de periode 1940-1987* (Den Haag: Algemeen Rijksarchief, 1998)\r\n\r\n- [1994] Erik Somers and Mark Pier, *Archievengids van de Tweede Wereldoorlogs. Nederland en Nederlands-Indië* (Zuthpen: Walburg Instituut, Rijksinstituut voor Oorlogsdocumentatie, 1994)\r\n\r\n- [1989] Atie van der Horst, Elly Koen, *Guide to the International Archives and Collections at the IISH* (Amsterdam: International Institute of Social History, 1989)\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Dutch archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAccording to the Dutch Public Records Act (1995), public archives are divided into State (Rijks), Communal (Gemeentelijke) and Regional (waterschaps) archival repositories. The National Archives [Nationaal Archief] are the central repository for archives transferred from national government bodies. The National Archivist is the head of the State Archive Service [Rijksarchiefdienst] and the Dutch National Archives. Besides the National Archives in The Hague, there are ten State Archives in the other provincial capitals, which were transformed (often after a merger with the city archives) into Regional Historical Centres [Regionaal Historische Centra] between 1998 and 2005. In addition to the state archives, there are collections in private archives and museums. A working knowledge of Dutch is necessary for any kind of archival research in the Netherlands, even though documents in other languages (German, English and French) can also be found with the help of the local archival staff.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on the Netherlands**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In the Netherlands**\r\n\r\nA considerable number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created in the Netherlands and can still be found in the country’s archives today. NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies holds important Holocaust collections. A joint effort of the National Archives and NIOD led to the creation of a website on Dutch WWII archival sources. A thematic query on “persecution of the Jews” leads to 773 archival collections in 142 archival institutions. These cover a broad variety of institutions, national as well as local and specialised institutions. There are also a number of private archives and documentation centres, such as the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam, which hold important Holocaust-related collections.\r\nEHRI identified over 160 repositories in the Netherlands and is able to provide thousands of descriptions of Holocaust-relevant archival units, most of which can be found at NIOD and at the Amsterdam City Archives.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections outside of the Netherlands that are relevant to Holocaust research on the Netherlands. In Germany and Israel, the Arolsen Archives and Yad Vashem hold significant documentation and a huge quantity of sources pertaining to Jewish individuals and/or groups during the Holocaust period.",

                "history": "Germany invaded neutral Norway on 9 April 1940, and Norwegian armed forces capitulated on 10 June. King Haakon VII and the government escaped to London, where they established a government-in-exile. The Germans appointed a civilian Reich Commissioner of occupied Norway, Josef Terboven. On 25 September 1940 the commissioner banned all political parties, except Nasjonal Samling, and in February 1942 set up a collaborationist government under Nasjonal Samling leader Vidkun Quisling which lasted until the liberation in May 1945.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the invasion, Norway had a total population of about 3 million people. Approximately 2,100 of them were Jews, including some 300-400 refugees from Germany and Austria. As the Germans prepared to invade the Soviet Union in early 1941, more and more Jews in Norway were arrested and incarcerated. In June 1941, all Jews in northern Norway were arrested. By early 1942, identity papers held by Jews had to be stamped with the letter “J”, and all Jews had to fill in a “registration form for Jews”. The fatal blow against Norwegian Jewry was struck by Quisling and Terboven in the autumn of 1942; in early October, all Jewish men in Trondheim were rounded up and on 26 and 27 October the Jewish men of Oslo were arrested by Norwegian police and paramilitary formations. A month later, the rest of Oslo's Jews were arrested by the Norwegian police and Norwegian Germanic SS units. Jewish property was confiscated. Some Jews were warned off by Norwegian policemen and members of the underground and managed to escape. Of the 772 Jews who had been arrested and deported to Auschwitz via Germany, only 34 survived and returned to Norway after the war. In Norway itself, 23 Jews died at the hands of the Nazis. About sixty percent of the Jewish population was able to escape to Sweden with the help of the Norwegian underground. Overall, 765 Jews from Norway perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nA “Gypsy clause” [“sigøynerparagrafen”] in the immigration law, practically denying the presence of Roma in Norway, had been introduced in 1927. It was not abolished until 1956. When Nazi Germany invaded Norway in 1940, the local authorities had already forced most of the small Norwegian Roma minority out of the country. Subsequently, Norwegian Roma were registered, stripped of their citizenships, expelled and denied reentry to the country. When the Second World War broke out, these persons lived as stateless foreigners on the European continent, primarily residing in Belgium and France. In 1943 and 1944, German and local police arrested and deported 66 Norwegian Roma from occupied Belgium to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Only four of them survived the war. In occupied Norway, in 1942, individuals within the Norwegian government began to discuss plans to establish Roma labor camps as well as forced sterilization. A registry of Roma was never conducted and any plans were halted by the Soviet invasion in 1944.",
                "summary": "EHRI was able to identify the National Archives of Norway as the main institution to hold Holocaust-relevant collections on Norway. Furthermore, the Jewish Museums in Oslo and Trondheim, Norway’s Resistance Museum and The Center for Studies of Holocaust and Religious Minorities (HL-senteret), which is financed by part of the settlement agreed between the Norwegian State and the Jewish communities, also contain some documentation on the Holocaust. Outside of Norway, EHRI has detected collections relevant to Holocaust research on Norway at the National Archives of Finland, as well as the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Yad Vashem, the German Bundesarchiv in Berlin-Lichterfelde and, to a lesser extent, at the Centre for Historical Records and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (CEGESOMA) in Brussels.",

                "history": "After 123 years of foreign rule by the Russian Empire, the Habsburg Monarchy and Prussia/Germany, Poland was reconstituted as an independent, multi-ethnic republic in November 1918. Helped by the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, and occupied the Western regions of the country. On 17 September, Soviet troops followed suit and marched into the Eastern parts of Poland, which were annexed to the Byelorussian and Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republics. The Vilnius (Wilno) area, on the other hand, became part of still-sovereign Lithuania. Germany split her newly conquered territories into areas that were incorporated into the Reich [“eingegliederte Gebiete”], and the German administered General Government in central Poland. Meanwhile, the Polish government, which had first been evacuated to Romania and France, set itself up in London and organized underground representation within occupied Poland, thus keeping in touch with resistance organizations within the country. When Germany turned on its Soviet ally and attacked the USSR in June 1941, Eastern Poland (most of which is part of present-day Belarus, Lithuania and Ukraine) fell under German occupation as well; the District of Galicia was attached to the General Government in August 1941. Nazi occupation in Poland was ended by the Red Army, first east of the Vistula River in the summer of 1944, then in the rest of the country in early 1945.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War, the Polish Republic had an estimated total population of 35 million inhabitants. Some 3,500,000 of them were Jews. Within weeks of the invasion, about two million Polish Jews came under German occupation. Individual murders by German soldiers were not uncommon during the early days of the war and discrimination against the Jewish population in general began immediately. Jewish property was confiscated, synagogues were demolished or devastated. Jews were forced to wear badges or armbands identifying them as Jews and were gradually confined in ghettos throughout the country. By early 1941, almost half a million people had been packed into the Warsaw ghetto alone where many would die as a result of the terrible living conditions there. In western Poland, which had been annexed immediately to the German Reich, and the western part of the Warsaw region, the Jewish population was expelled further east or transferred into larger ghettos (principally Warsaw and Łódź). In June 1941, the mass extermination of Jews began in Eastern Poland. From December 1941, Jews were systematically murdered in the parts of Poland which had been under German occupation since 1939. The first extermination centre was established in Chełmno [Kulmhof], north of Łódź. Its victims were not only Polish Jews from the regions annexed to the Reich, but also German, Austrian and Czech Jews who had previously been deported to the Litzmannstadt ghetto. Within the framework of Operation Reinhardt, the German authorities established extermination centres (Bełżec, Sobibór and Treblinka) aimed at the extermination of the whole Jewish population of the General Government. The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in spring 1943 was crushed by the Germans and the ghetto itself destroyed. Some Jews were sent to the Lublin-Majdanek and Auschwitz concentration camps, where the majority were murdered. Jews from other European countries were also deported to these camps to be killed. While Operation Reinhardt ended in 1943, mass murder did not. The gas chambers in the concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau operated until 1944. The inhabitants of ghettos which had so far been spared found their end here: Jews from the Białystok and the Zagłębie regions were killed in 1943, those from Litzmannstadt in 1944. At the same time, Jews were brought to Auschwitz from various countries occupied or dominated by Germany, for example Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, Hungary and the Netherlands. They were submitted to selection: the able-bodied were sent to the concentration camps, the others (including the children) were murdered on the spot. The last Jewish victims of Nazi mass murder in Poland were the concentration camp inmates, who died from exhaustion or were shot during the evacuation of the camps (during the so-called Death Marches, for instance from Auschwitz and Stutthof). Soviet Army troops were the first to approach a major Nazi camp in Poland at Majdanek in July 1944 and to overrun the previously dismantled death camp sites of Bełżec, Sobibór and Treblinka. In January 1945, they liberated Auschwitz. About 3 million Jews from within the pre-war borders of Poland did not survive the war (two thirds of whom died in the territory of present-day Poland). Approximately 13% of the Polish Jewish pre-war population survived the war, mostly as refugees or deportees in the unoccupied parts of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nPoland had a population of approximately 50,000 Roma before the war. Almost immediately after the occupation, Polish Roma became subject to pogroms and mass shootings. There are approximately 180 sites of murder that have been identified such as the killing of the Roma of Szczurowa. Local collaborators often participated in the mass killings. Since May 1940 2,500 Sinti and Roma from Germany were put into camps and ghettos in the General Government. Sinti and Roma on Polish territory were deported to concentration and extermination camps like Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka or Majdanek. It is estimated that 35,000 Roma were killed during the war.",
                "summary": "In Poland, EHRI has identified the SEZAM and Szukaj w Archiwach (Search in the Archives) databases as the most accessible archival research tools which are available online (http://baza.archiwa.gov.pl/sezam/sezam.php?l=en and http://szukajwarchiwach.pl/).

A full list is available in an extensive report.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Poland: Pre-existing research and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Poland, EHRI could rely on a vast amount of pre-existing research on the Holocaust. Research on this topic has been conducted for decades now by historians not only in Poland, Germany, the United States and Israel, but also in a number of other countries. Consequently, EHRI is unable to give a full and up-to-date account of the available literature here. However, it is important to highlight the 16 volume series *Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der europäischen Juden durch das nationalsozialistische Deutschland 1933-1945*, which is being published by EHRI-partner Institute for Contemporary History Munich-Berlin [Institut für Zeitgeschichte München-Berlin, IfZ] and Bundesarchiv, especially volumes 4 and 9, and 10. All volumes contain introductions based on international research literature and (as of 2024) are being translated into English (pmj-documents.org). Furthermore, the *Jewish History Quarterly* [*Kwartalnik Historii Żydów*], which is published by the Warsaw-based Emanuel Ringelblum Jewish Historical Institute [Żydowski Institut Historyczny im. Emanuela Ringelbluma, ŻIH] and the periodical “Zagłada Żydów” are probably the most reliable periodicals on current Holocaust research on Poland.\r\n\r\nEHRI has also relied on the following archival guides:\r\n- [1998-2011] Jóźwik, Marek (eds.), *Relacje z czasów zagłady - inwentarz / Holocaust survivors testimonies catalogue*, Archiwum ŻIH - INB, zespół 301 (Warsaw, Instytut Naukowo-Badawczy, 1998-2011)\r\n- [2009] Bednarek, Jerzy & Rafał Leśkiewicz (eds.), *Informator o zasobie archiwalnym Instytutu Pamięci Narodowej* (stan na dzień 31 grudnia 2008 roku) (Warszawa: IPN, 2009)\r\n- [2009] Shapiro, Robert Moses and Epsztein, Tadeusz, *The Warsaw Ghetto Oyneg Shabes-Ringelblum Archive, catalog and guide*, Bloomington, IN (Indiana Univ.

Informator o materiałach źródłowych przechowywanych w archiwach PRL* (Warszawa, 1972)\r\n\r\nWith EHRI’s help, the most comprehensive guide has been updated and translated from Polish into English: Alina Skibińska, *Guide to the Sources on the Holocaust in Occupied Poland* (Translated and expanded edition of the original *Polish Źródła do badań nad zagładą Żydów na okupowanych ziemiach polskich* by Alina Skibińska, Warsaw, 2007), European Holocaust Research Infrastructure, 2014, https://training.ehri-project.eu/sites/training/files/portal_assets/skibinska_guide.pdf.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Poland’s archival situation and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nUntil around 1990, the Polish state archival system imitated Soviet structures, which involved strong tendencies towards centralisation and almost complete inaccessibility. The network of Polish state archives opened up only after the crumbling of the Soviet bloc and the fall of communism in Poland. Since then, the network of state archives has functioned under the Head Office of State Archives [Naczelna Dyrekcja Archiwów Państwowych, NDAP].\r\n\r\nIn addition to the NDAP network, there is the Institute of National Remembrance [Instytut Pamięci Narodowej, IPN] which was created in 1998 as a successor organisation to the Main Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes [Główna Komisja Badania Zbrodni Hitlerowskich]. As the name suggests, it stores mainly documents on Nazi Crimes transferred from state archives, but also increasingly state security service files from the post-war period.\r\n\r\nOutside of the state archival and IPN networks, there is a wide range of archival institutions which hold Holocaust-relevant collections. There is, of course, the Jewish Historical Institute [Żydowski Instytut Historyczny, ŻIH] in Warsaw, which deserves a special mention as a key institution for Holocaust research on Poland and beyond, but also the network of church archives throughout Poland, and various archives of central administrative institutions, such as the Central Statistical Office [Główny Urząd Statystyczny, GUS]. The Archive of the Polish Red Cross also deserves to be mentioned. Finally, there are a number of state museums which were created in former German concentration camps (most importantly in Auschwitz, but also Majdanek) which hold, to a certain extent, archival material relevant for Holocaust research on Poland. A number of private institutions are also likely to hold Holocaust-relevant sources; important private research centres are “Karta” in Warsaw and Brama Grodzka in Lublin.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Poland**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Poland**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified over 100 archival institutions in Poland which hold or may hold Holocaust-relevant collections. At this point, it appears that a number of state archives which exist in all the major cities and in some regional centres throughout the country hold the most extensive Holocaust-relevant collections. The Central Archives of Modern Records [Archiwum Akt Nowych, AAN] in Warsaw and the local state archives hold essential collections concerning the German occupation in Poland, sources produced by the Polish resistance movement, but also documents created in the numerous ghettos in occupied Poland. In this regard, the State Archive in Łódź deserves a special mention, as it holds the archive of the Litzmannstadt ghetto. The Warsaw-based Jewish Historical Institute (ŻIH) stores the underground archive of the Warsaw ghetto (Ringelblum Archive), a key collection to Holocaust research in Poland. The ŻIH’s collections of testimonies and memoirs which were written and recorded after the war cover all of occupied Poland, including its former eastern territories (today Belarus, Lithuania and Ukraine), and even Germany, as former inmates of German camps and forced labourers in Germany left their testimonies at the Institute as well. In terms of the sheer quantity of sources, the collections described by EHRI in the state archives of Bydgoszcz, Lublin, Łódź, Poznań and Warsaw appear to be the most significant ones so far. Obviously, the somewhat smaller archival holdings identified elsewhere in Poland archives are not necessarily less important.\r\n\r\nThe collection descriptions in EHRI have been added from the archives’ databases (in Polish), combined with the English information in the Skibińska guide.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nAlina Skibińska’s *Guide to the Sources on the Holocaust in Occupied Poland* (Translated and expanded edition of the original Polish *Źródła do badań nad zagładą Żydów na okupowanych ziemiach polskich* by Alina Skibińska, Warsaw, 2007), European Holocaust Research Infrastructure, 2014, https://training.ehri-project.eu/sites/training/files/portal_assets/skibinska_guide.pdf includes information on sources on Poland held at repositories in Germany, Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States.",

                "history": "From 1933 onwards, Portugal was under the authoritarian regime of António de Oliveira Salazar: the Estado Novo. In September 1939, the country proclaimed its neutrality. In the first months of the war, Portugal had a liberal visa policy which became more restrictive from the end of 1940 to the spring of 1941. In August 1943, Portugal and Great Britain signed an agreement which allowed the British army to use Portuguese bases in the Azores. During the war, the country continued to export goods to both sides.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the war, Portugal had a total population of 7,722,152 people; approximately 380 of them were Jews and there were 650 Jewish refugees (mostly from Central Europe) with a quasi-resident status. About 80,000 to 100,000 Jews and other refugees were able to flee Nazi-controlled Europe via Lisbon, which was the only neutral transatlantic harbour left in Western Europe after the occupation of France in June 1940. Staying in Portugal, however, was not an option, since the country’s government allowed Jews to enter on the condition that they would only use Portugal as a transit point. Various rescue projects were coordinated from the country, such as the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) – a US-based Quaker aid society – and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee which reopened its European office in Lisbon in 1940. Several Portuguese Jewish expatriate citizens were incarcerated in the so-called “neutrals’ camps” [“Neutralenlager”] in Germany.\r\n\r\nFor this country there are no sufficient findings on the history of Roma during the Second World War. EHRI would be pleased to receive any information. ",

                "history": "After the Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement of August 1939 assigned Bessarabia to the Soviet sphere of interest, the Kingdom of Romania was pressured by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany into handing over disputed territories to the Soviet Union (Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and Dorohoi), Hungary (Northern Transylvania) and Bulgaria (Southern Dobruja) in the summer and autumn of 1940. King Carol II was forced to abdicate in September 1940. In his place, General Ion Antonescu formed a government with the far-right Legionary Movement (also known as the Iron Guard party), proclaiming the National Legionary State. It lasted until January 1941, when Antonescu suppressed a coup of the Legionary Movement and forced it out of government. On 23 November 1940, Romania officially joined the Axis alliance. Romania participated in the German invasion of the Soviet Union in July 1941. Subsequently, Romania regained Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia and also administered its own zone of occupation in Soviet territory in Transnistria. The Antonescu regime was overthrown on 23 August 1944, as Soviet troops began entering the country from the east. Romania declared war on Germany in late August that same year and went on to fight alongside the Red Army.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War, Romania had a total population of about 19 million people. Approximately 760,000 of them were Jews, which meant Romania had the third largest Jewish population in Europe after Poland and the Soviet Union. In the summer and autumn of 1940, the annexation of Romanian territory by the Soviet Union, Hungary and Bulgaria lowered the Jewish population of Romania to less than 330,000. Long before Antonescu’s coup, antisemitism had been on the rise in Romania, especially in the eastern territories. The situation worsened with the rise of popular far-right movements. Pogroms and mass shootings took place in the summer of 1940, in the context of the Romanian army’s retreat from territories lost to the Soviet Union, with 400 Jews shot in Galați and 50 in Dorohoi. Another wave of antisemitic violence was recorded when the Legionary Movement was in power. After the defeat of the Legionary Movement's coup attempt, Ion Antonescu introduced systematic antisemitic measures. With the onset of the attack against the Soviet Union, Romanian authorities and Nazi Germany committed mass murder of Jews in northeastern Romania, Bessarabia, Bukovina, and Transnistria. On 29 June 1941, in the city of Iași, about 13,000 Jews were killed in an organised massacre by the Romanian authorities as well as during the subsequent deportations. In the summer of 1941, Romanian and German units, including Einsatzgruppe D, killed tens of thousands of Jews in Bukovina and Bessarabia (territories regained from the Soviet Union). Antonescu ordered the banishment of the approximately 150,000 remaining Jews to Transnistria. Thousands died on the way, others were systematically executed by Romanian gendarmes, Ukrainian militias and German paramilitaries after they arrived in Transnistria. In September 1943, only approximately 50,000 were still alive in the “colonies”, ghettos and concentration camps there. Most of the Ukrainian Jews native to Transnistria, including those of Odesa, were killed by Romanian and Ethnic German [“Volksdeutsche”] units between October 1941 and March 1942. In the summer of 1942, Antonescu began to back away from his extermination policy and mass deportations to Belzec were canceled. While emigration was now emphasized, no significant opportunities materialized during the course of the war. More than 280,000 Jews were murdered or died during the Holocaust in Romania and the territories under its control. Additionally, 135,000 Jews from Northern Transylvania, who were under Hungarian rule between 1940 and 1944, perished.\r\n\r\nAccording to a 1930 census there were 262,501 people who considered themselves to be of Roma descent. On May 25, 1942 Marshall Antonescu ordered a census of Roma in order to organize a deportation to Transnistria. Approximately 25,000 Roma were deported to around 100 locations in Transnistria, where about 11,000 of them died.",

EHRI has surveyed and identified important Holocaust related collections stored by the National Archives of Romania, Historical Military Archives, the ‘Elie Wiesel’ Institute and the Institute for Holocaust and Genocide Studies.\r\n\r\nOutside of Romania, EHRI was able to identify vast Holocaust-relevant collections at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, which holds numerous selected records from various Romanian archives, institutions, organizations and individuals pertaining to the Holocaust period. They contain important source material produced by central government bodies, military and civilian authorities. Furthermore, Yad Vashem possesses important Holocaust-relevant material on Romania, such as the Wilhelm Filderman Archive: Chairman of the Federation of Jewish Communities in Romania, 1924-1947, and the Romanian Collection, which contains documentation on the history of Romanian Jews during the Holocaust period. Due to Romania’s expansion into Soviet territory during the Second World War, vast collections of Holocaust-relevant sources regarding Romania could also be identified in Ukraine, especially at the State Archives of the Odessa and Mykolaiv Oblasts, and in Moldova.",

These works include the following document editions and monographs: Matatias Carp, *Cartea neagră. Fapte şi documente. Suferinţele evreilor din România în timpul dictaturii fasciste 1940-1944* (*The Black Book. Facts and Documents. The Sufferings of the Jews in Romania during the Fascist Dictatorship 1940-1944*), 3 vols, (Bucharest: Socec, 1946-1948); Jean Ancel, *Documents Concerning the Fate of the Romanian Jewry during the Holocaust*, 12 vols. (New York: Beate Klarsfeld Foundation, 1986); Jean Ancel, *Transnistria, 1941-1942*, 3 vols. (Tel Aviv: The Goldstein-Goren Diaspora Research Center, 2003); *Evreii din România între anii 1940-1944* (*The Jews in Romania between 1940-1944*), 4 vols. (Bucharest: Hasefer, 1993-1998); Radu Ioanid, *The Holocaust in Romania: The Destruction of Jews and Roma under the Antonescu Regime, 1940-1944*, second edition (New York: Rowman & Littlefield, 2022); Dennis Deletant, *Hitler's Forgotten Ally: Ion Antonescu and his Regime, Romania 1940-1944* (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006); Diana Dumitru, *The State, Antisemitism, and Collaboration in the Holocaust: The Borderlands of Romania and the Soviet Union* (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2016); Vladimir Solonari, *Purifying the Nation: Population Exchange and Ethnic Cleansing in Nazi-Allied Romania* (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010); Vladimir Solonari, *The Satellite Empire. Romanian Rule in Southwestern Ukraine* (Ithaca & London: Cornell University Press, 2019); Alexandru Florian (ed.), *Munca obligatorie a evreilor din România (1940-1944) Documente* (*The Forced Work of Jews in Romania, 1940-1944, Documents*) (Bucharest: Polirom, 2013). EHRI has also relied on third parties that had previously carried out survey and copying work, such as the USHMM and Yad Vashem.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Romania's archival system**\r\n\r\nRomania has a centralized archival system with the National Archives of Romania [Arhivele Naţionale ale României, NAR] in charge of the State archival system. The state archives are made up of one major archive in Bucharest and multiple county branch archives. Several other state archives have their own archival system and collections. These include the Military National Archives of Romania, the Diplomatic Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Council for the Study of Securitate Archives.\r\n\r\nAccess to data in the NAR benefited from a protocol signed between NAR and the EHRI partner in Romania, the ‘Elie Wiesel’ National Institute for the Study of Holocaust in Romania. Access to data in the Military Archives was done via the Elie Wiesel Institute archival database.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Romania**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Romania**\r\n\r\nIn Romania, EHRI has identified several archival institutions which hold documents on Romania, Bessarabia, Bukovina and Transnistria. For these institutions, EHRI has made over 1,000 Holocaust-relevant archival descriptions available. In the NAR, EHRI identified documents on actions of the Jewish Central Office in Romania, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Work, Health and Social Protection, Presidency of the Council of Ministers. These collections cover administrative, political and judicial orders, decisions, reports, issued by Romanian authorities related to administration in Romania, Bessarabia, Bukovina and Transnistria. In the Military Archives, EHRI identified documents concerning military decisions mainly covering the Romanian governorates in Bessarabia, Bukovina Transnistria.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Romania, EHRI was able to identify vast Holocaust-relevant collections at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, which holds numerous selected records from various Romanian archives, institutions, organisations and individuals pertaining to the Holocaust period. They contain important source material produced by central government bodies, military and civilian authorities. Furthermore, Yad Vashem possesses important Holocaust-relevant material on Romania, such as the Wilhelm Filderman Archive: Chairman of the Federation of Jewish Communities in Romania, 1924-1947, and the Romanian Collection, which contains documentation on the history of Romanian Jews during the Holocaust period. Due Romania’s expansion into Soviet territory during the Second World War, vast collections of Holocaust-relevant sources regarding Romania could also be identified in Ukraine, especially at the State Archives of the Odessa and Mykolaiv Oblasts, and in Moldova.",

                "history": "An internationally recognised independent state since 1878, Serbia joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918, which then became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. In April 1941, when Germany’s twelve-day campaign against Yugoslavia led to its partition between the Axis powers and their allies, the Yugoslav government was evacuated to London. Following the capitulation, most of Serbia’s present-day territory was administered by the German military under the “Militärbefehlshaber Serbien” in Belgrade. The rest of the territory was annexed by neighbouring countries: northern Bačka by Hungary; some south-east areas by Bulgaria, the south-west areas by Italian-controlled Albania; and the north-west Syrmia region by the Independent State of Croatia [Nezavisna Država Hrvatska], which had been formed on 10 April 1941. The German occupiers were driven out of the Yugoslav capital Belgrade by the Red Army and local Communist partisan units in October 1944. Serbia then became one of six republics within the post-war Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. When Yugoslavia dissolved during the 1990s, Serbia became an independent state again.\r\n\r\nIn 1941, about 33,500 Jews lived in Serbia, among them some 16,000 lived in the German occupied areas of Serbia, out of a population of about 3,810,000. Soon, the new authorities issued anti-Jewish laws. Those considered Jews were forced to wear the Jewish badge, expelled from certain professions and restricted to living in certain areas. By the summer of 1941, all Jewish men between the ages of 16 and 60 were rounded up for forced labour. Jews also fell victim to German reprisals against the local resistance movement. Notably, the German military authorities threatened to retaliate by executing 50 Serbian hostages for every German injured and 100 for every German soldier killed; the Germans met their quota by executing Jews, hoping to avoid antagonising the gentile local population any further. By early autumn 1941, most of the Jewish men of Serbia had been imprisoned in local concentration camps, and mass executions began. By December, the majority of Jewish men, about 5,000 people, had been killed. Exceptions were made for those who were needed for forced labour. At the same time, about 8,000 Jewish women, children and elderly people were sent to a fairground which had been turned into an internment camp at Sajmište near Belgrade. From March to May 1942, more than 6,000 inmates were killed in gas vans, while another 1,200 died of exposure or starvation. By the summer of 1942, only a very few Jews were left in Serbia, surviving either by hiding or by joining the Partisans. In total, about 14,500 Jews were murdered in the German-controlled part of Serbia during the war.\r\n\r\nIn the Bulgarian-occupied zone of Serbia—Macedonia and southeast Serbia—Jews were arrested in 1943 and deported to the Treblinka death camp. In the Hungarian-occupied part of Serbia, Jews were among the victims of the Hungarian killings at Novi Sad in January 1942. In the Albanian-occupied area of Serbia, the Germans, supported by an Albanian SS-Division, arrested Jews from Kosovo and Jewish refugees from other parts of Yugoslavia. They were sent to the Sajmište camp and one month later to Bergen-Belsen. In the entirety of present-day Serbia, some 27,000 Jews out of about 33,500 (over 80%) perished.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to estimate the number of Roma in German-occupied Serbia. According to the 1931 census, 30,000 Roma lived in Serbia (excluding Kosovo, Metohia and Vojvodina). Shortly after the occupation German authorities enacted anti-Roma legal racist provisions (banned the performance of certain jobs) and deported Roma. They were deported to camps such as Banjica and Sajmište in the Belgrade area or in the concentration camp known as “Red Cross” in Niš, where they were tortured and killed. One of the places of mass executions of Roma was in the area of ​​the village of Jabuka, near Pancevo. Roma were victims of German mass shootings of civilians as a reprisal for the killing of German soldiers. In August 1942, German occupation authorities reported that the “Gypsy question” had been “solved” in Serbia. Roma were also victims of Chetnik military units and the Hungarian occupation authorities, and some of them joined the anti-fascist partisan movement. While the number of victims of the shootings in 1941 and early 1942 can be estimated at around 2,500, there are no reliable figures for the total number of Roma victims in German occupied Serbia (which is in some cases estimated at 20,000). In the first post-war population census conducted in 1948 in the territory of today's Serbia (including the areas of Vojvodina, Kosovo and Metohija) 52,181 Roma were enumerated.",
                "summary": "In Serbia, EHRI has identified ten Holocaust-relevant repositories, most of which are located in the country’s capital, Belgrade:\r\n- Archives of Yugoslavia [Arhiv Jugoslavije],\r\n- Diplomatic Archive of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia [Diplomatski arhiv Ministarstva spoljnih poslova Republike Srbije],\r\n- Federation of the Jewish Communities of Serbia [Savez jevrejskih opština Srbije],\r\n- Historical Archives of Belgrade [Istorijski arhiv Beograda],\r\n- Institute for Contemporary History [Institut za savremenu istoriju]\r\n- Jewish Historical Museum [Jevrejski istorijski muzej] in Belgrad,\r\n- Military Archive [Vojni arhiv] at the Serbian Ministry of Defense,\r\n- Yugoslav Film Archive [Arhiv Jugoslovenske Kinoteke].\r\n\r\nOutside of Belgrade, there are important archives in Novi Sad:\r\n- Archive of Vojvodina [Arhiv Vojvodine],\r\n- Historical Archive of Novi Sad [Istorijski arhiv Novog Sada].\r\n- The Museum of Vojvodina [Muzej Vojvodine]\r\n\r\nOf the regional archives, Niš, Kragujevac, Šabac, Kraljevo, Zaječar, Požarevac, Bor, Užice, Loznica, Zrenjanin, Pančevo, Vršac, Sremska Mitrovica, Sombor and Subotica are the most significant for Holocaust research.\r\n\r\nAt this point, there is no remembrance institution in Serbia exclusively dedicated to the Holocaust, but EHRI has identified other institutions that are likely to hold Holocaust-related material, namely: the Serbian National Library; the Library of the Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences; the Matica srpska Library in Novi Sad; the Museum of Yugoslav History; the Military Museum; the Museum of the City of Belgrade; the Memorial Park Kragujevački oktobar; and the memorial museum at Red Cross Camp in Niš [Logor Crveni krst].\r\n\r\nOutside of Serbia, sources relevant to Holocaust research on Serbia can be found at the United State Holocaust Memorial Museum, Yad Vashem and the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies. Archival institutions in other successor states of former Yugoslavia are also likely to hold relevant collections.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Serbia: Pre-existing research, third-party surveys and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Serbia, EHRI could rely on a number of pre-existing works on the Holocaust in Serbia. Some important websites that are also very useful for locating the historical sources include:\r\n- killingsites.org: a website about the killing sites around Belgrade where the Jews were shot in 1941. The website is the result of an international project and there are several archival documents available.\r\n- holokaust.arhiv-beograda.org: a website about the victims of the Sajmiste concentration camp with a list of victims and archival documents from the Historical Archive of Belgrade.\r\n- topovskesupe.rs: a website for the Mapping the Holocaust – The Topovske Šupe Camp project, which aims to present a digitized history of the Topovske Šupe camp to the public. It contains various archival material related to the camp and its victims.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Serbia’s archival situation and specific challenges**\r\nThe most relevant Holocaust repositories and collections in Serbia are:\r\n\r\n*The Serbian Military Archives* \r\n\r\n- *Collection of Microfilms relating to the German occupation from 1941 to 1945*\r\n\r\nThis fonds contains documentation concerning German military units and authorities in Yugoslavia. The material is arranged and processed following geographical and thematic sets. Many documents are copies from the Freiburg Military Archives.\r\n\r\n- *Serbian Government of Milan Nedic 1941-1945 fond*\r\n\r\nAccess to the military archive is very limited for non-Serbian citizens and they have to follow a particular procedure for obtaining the permission to conduct research in the Military Archives.\r\n\r\n*Archives of Yugoslavia*\r\n\r\n- *The State Commission for the Investigation of the Crimes of Occupiers and their Supporters fond*\r\n\r\nThe fonds contains strictly classified, original documents of the Nazi occupiers and their local fascist allies, as well as testimonies and inquiries conducted by Yugoslav authorities immediately after the war in order to record all the crimes committed against civilians in Yugoslavia and seek out and prosecute those responsible.\r\n\r\n- *The Royal Yugoslav Government-in-exile*\r\n\r\nDocuments on the Holocaust can also be found in this fonds. Many of these documents are reports which were sent from occupied Yugoslavia to the Royal Yugoslav Government in London.\r\n\r\n*The Historical Archives of Belgrade*\r\n\r\n- *Commander of Security Police and Security Services BdS/Befehlshaber der Sicherheitspolizei und des Sicherheitsdienstes fond*\r\n\r\nIn this fonds, there is a focus on Gestapo documents, particularly personal dossiers, and it is considered one of the few intact Gestapo document collections in all of Europe.\r\n\r\n- *Belgrade City Administration fond*\r\n\r\nDragi Jovanović, president of the Administration of the City of Belgrade, was one of the most reliable allies of the Nazi occupiers. The Special Police operated under his command, and in particular, the Police Department for Jews and Gypsies, which played an active role in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\n- *The Municipality of Belgrade fond*\r\n\r\nThe Municipality of Belgrade was in charge of administering the city. For this reason, this fonds contains materials concerning daily life in Belgrade during the Second World War.\r\n\r\n*The Jewish Historical Museum of Belgrade*\r\n\r\nEven though the Jewish Historical Museum does not have a particularly large collection dedicated to the Holocaust (the material mostly consists of copies from other archives), some interesting documents, such as the survivors’ testimonies, are very useful.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Serbia**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Serbia**\r\n\r\nEHRI identified several Holocaust repositories in Serbia and focused on four of the most relevant: the Archives of Yugoslavia, the Military Archive, the Historical Archive of Belgrade and the Jewish Historical Museum. \r\nDuring the research survey multiple fonds were selected and hundreds of documents were consulted and described. Approximately, these fonds represent more than 80% of the available documents in Serbia covering the Holocaust in German-occupied Serbia. They cover other topics as well, including the flight of Jews from Serbia and the Independent State of Croatia to the Italian controlled territories, the killing of the Jews from Bačka under Hungarian occupation in the Bor copper mines, and the crimes in the Independent State of Croatia.\r\n\r\nLocal archives preserve information about the small Jewish communities in other cities (Niš, Kragujevac, Sabac and others), while the Archives of Vojvodina preserve documents that are primarily concerned with the killing of the Jews from Novi Sad and the Bačka region under Hungarian, and later Nazi, control. Also located in Novi Sad, the Museum of Vojvodina’s Holocaust-relevant holdings have been described in the EHRI Portal.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nEven though a detailed survey of archives outside of Serbia has not yet been conducted, we note that documents related to the Holocaust in Serbia are preserved in German repositories, such as the Bundesarchiv and the Arolsen Archives. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has also collected many relevant documents, while the Russian State Military Archive should hold the records of the Serbian Jewish communities before and during WWII.",

                "history": "When Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, its armies advanced quickly through the Soviet republics on the Baltic Sea, as well as Belorussia and Ukraine, before entering the territory of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Hoping to win the war within a few months, the German forces were stopped near Moscow at the end of 1941. Unable to resume the offensive on the entire eastern front in the spring of 1942, they opted for a push towards the south-east, occupying all of Ukraine in the process and reaching the Northern Caucasus by August 1942. At this point, Germany had captured a vast geographical space between besieged Leningrad and the Northern Caucasus. All the German-occupied territory of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, including the Crimean Peninsula, came under German military administration. Most of it was liberated again by the Red Army in 1943. Soviet troops returned to the North Caucasus in January-February 1943 and to central-western Russia mainly in the summer and autumn of 1943. The western regions of the Soviet Union remained under German rule until 1944.\r\n\r\nIn 1939, some 109,000,000 people lived in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. On the eve of the invasion, there were some 207,000 Jews in the territories that were to come under German occupation, about one percent of the total population in that area. During the first months of the war, most Jews either managed to escape on their own, or they were evacuated by the Soviet government, generally to the Northern Caucasus and to southern Russia. Jewish evacuees were relocated to southern Russia until mid-December 1941. This area came under German occupation in 1942. Due to the speed of the German advance, however, and poor means of transportation, a considerable number of Jews could not get away in time and found themselves under German occupation. The German murder campaign against the Jews on Russian territory was carried out by the Einsatzgruppen. It started as early as summer 1941 in the northwest and in many places in the central-western region of Russia and lasted until the beginning of 1943. In the south-western territories of Russia, including the Northern Caucasus, which were occupied only between July and November 1942, the murder of the Jews began later and the period of extermination was very short. According to estimates, the extermination of the Jews in Russia between 1941 and 1943 left between 60,000 and 100,000 dead.\r\n\r\nAccording to a census in 1939, there were 88,242 “Tsygane” living in the territory of the Soviet Union, the vast majority (61,262) of whom lived in the territory of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR; at the time including Crimea). In the context of the nationality policy of the 1920s and 1930s, Roma activists had founded their own organization, cultural institutions like the theatre Romėn and some kolkhozes. In the German-occupied areas of Russia, Roma were executed in mass shootings, which began in the spring of 1942 (Crimea was a special case: there, Roma were murdered as early as the autumn of 1941). Many Roma fought in the Red Army or joined the partisan movement. It is estimated that up to 20,000 Roma were murdered in the territory of the RSFSR.",
                "summary": "EHRI has identified a number of helpful archival guides on Russia, some of which are available online. A list is provided in the extensive report. Preliminary contact with key Holocaust research and archival institutions in Russia has been established in order to facilitate future exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in the country. In order to identify the Russian archival institutions which store Holocaust-relevant resources, EHRI relied on expert knowledge readily available in EHRI’s partner institutions, such as Yad Vashem and the Warsaw-based Jewish Historical Institute [Żydowski Instytut Historyczny, ŻIH]. As a result, EHRI has identified over 50 archives which either certainly hold Holocaust-relevant material or can be expected to do so. While the full list can also be found in the extensive report, at least five central institutions should be named here:\r\n- the State Archives of the Russian Federation (GARF) in Moscow, which include the files of the Extraordinary State Committee to Investigate German Fascist Crimes Committed on Soviet Territory, the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee files as well as the Nuremberg Collection;\r\n- the Russian State Archives of Socio-Political History (RGASPI) in Moscow, which hold the files of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the General Headquarters of the Partisans in the Soviet Union with reports on the occupied areas. Based on the results of a joint survey of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Yad Vashem, EHRI has integrated several collection descriptions from RGASPI;\r\n- the Central Archives of the Russian Defence Ministry (TsAMO) in Podolsk, which hold reports from Red Army records (Main Political Administration of the Red Army, GLAVPUR) resembling those of the Partisan’s General HQ in RGASPI and store “trophy” (captured) documents mostly of German provenance;\r\n- the Russian State Military Archives [Rossiiskii gosudarstvennyi voennyi arkhiv, RGVA], which house a large number of similarly captured collections not only of German provenance, but also many related to the Jewish communities in France, Belgium, Greece, Austria etc.; and\r\n- an extensive collection of interviews with local citizens and Red Army servicemen conducted right after the liberation of territories of the Soviet Union is held by the Scientific Archive of the Russian History Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences\r\n\r\nRegional archives hold local files generated by the abovementioned Extraordinary Commission, as well as material from local occupation administrations such as administrative files, lists of persecuted or displaced citizens, propaganda newspapers etc. Most documents related to Holocaust can be found in two types of collections: in the fonds of the local Extraordinary Commission and in the fonds of the Partisan movement. The Extraordinary Commission Fonds is usually held by the central State archive, while the documents about partisan movement can be found in the former party archive. In the regional centers usually there are two archives: State archives and the former party archives.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Russia: Pre-existing research, available archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nEHRI’s exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in Russia was able to rely on some important pre-existing research in the field, which tends, however, to deal with “Russia” under the more general heading of the Soviet Union. Dieter Pohl’s *Die Herrschaft der Wehrmacht. Deutsche Militärbesatzung und einheimische Bevölkerung in der Sowjetunion 1941-1944* (2008) and Yitzhak Arad’s *The Holocaust in the Soviet Union* (2009), Ilja Al’tman’s *Zhertvy nenavisti. Kholokost v SSSR, 1941-1945* (2002) which have made use of archival material Russia long before EHRI, should be mentioned.\r\n\r\nEHRI was also able to identify a number of helpful archival guides, some of which are available online:\r\n\r\n- http://www.iisg.nl/abb/ for archives in Russia in general;\r\n\r\n- http://rusarchives.ru/index.shtml;\r\n\r\n- http://www.bsb-muenchen.de/mikro/litten.htm lists finding aids for the State Archives of the Russian Federation [Gosudarstvennyi arkhiv Rossiiskoy Federatsyi, GARF];\r\n\r\n- http://komiswow.ru is a website dedicated to the Commission on the History of the Great Patriotic War (also known as the Mints Commission) Archive\r\n\r\nSome latest initiatives for digitizing documents should also be mentioned:\r\n\r\n- http://rgaspi-458-9.germandocsinrussia.org\r\n\r\n- http://agk.mid.ru/fonds/sekretariat-v-m-molotova/sekretariat-v-m-molotova/\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the following traditional archival guides, ordered by year of publication, are available:\r\n\r\n- [2002] Al’tman, Ilya, *Zhertvy nenavisti. Kholokost v SSSR, 1941-1945* (Moskva, fonds “Kovcheg”)\r\n\r\n- [2011] Kovalev, Boris, “Archivnye materialy FSB RF o kholokoste na okkupirovannoi territorii Rossii”, in: *Kholokost: Novye issledovaniia i materialy* (37, 2011: 26-34)\r\n\r\n- [2005] Fishman, David, Mark Kupovetsky and Vladimir Kuzelenkov (eds.), *Dokumenty po istorii i kulture evreev v trofeinykh kollektsiakh Rossiiskogo Gosudarstvennogo Voennogo arkhiva: Putevoditel* (Jewish Documentary Sources Among the Trophy Collections of the Russian State Military Archive) (Moskva: RGGU, 2005)\r\n\r\n- [1996] Evreiskiy *Antifashistskiy Komitet v SSSR, 1941-1948: Dokumentirovannaya Istoriya* (Moskva: Mezhdunarodnye otnosheniya)\r\n[2000] Grimsted, Patricia Kennedy (ed.), *Archives of Russia: A Directory and Bibliographic Guide to Holdings in Moscow and St. Petersburg* (Armonk, NY: M.

The selection of described collections was also based on the results of a joint survey of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Yad Vashem.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Russia’s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe senior authority in the archival system of Russia is the Federal Archival Agency [Rosarkhiv]. Only the federal archives are under its actual authority. In other words, only the archives situated in Moscow, such as State Archives of the Russian Federation (GARF), the Russian State Archives of Socio-Political History (RGASPI), and others. There are also ministerial archives, which are not subject to the authority of Rosarkhiv. Important examples include the Central Archive of the Russian Defence Ministry (TsAMO) and the archives of the security services. The Regional Archives are only partially subordinated to the Rosarkhiv as they largely depend on the local authorities.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Russia**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Russia**\r\n\r\nImportant Holocaust-related collections at the State Archives of the Russian Federation (GARF) include the files of the Extraordinary State Committee to Investigate German Fascist Crimes Committed on Soviet Territory, the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee files as well as the Nuremberg Collection. The Russian State Archives of Socio-Political History (RGASPI) most importantly holds the files of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the General Headquarters of the Partisans in the Soviet Union, which contain reports on the occupied areas. Similar reports from the Red Army Main Political Directorate (GLAVPUR) records can be found at the Central Archive of the Russian Defence Ministry (TsAMO), which also houses captured “trophy” documents mostly of German provenance. The Russian State Military Archive (RGVA) houses a large number of similarly captured collections. Regional archives hold local files generated by the abovementioned Extraordinary Commission as well as material from local occupation administrations.\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified over 50 archival institutions which hold or are likely to hold Holocaust-relevant material in Russia. A dozen of them are concentrated in Moscow. Three more are located in cities near Moscow: Podolsk, Domodedovo and Krasnogorsk. A smaller cluster of relevant archival institutions is located in or near St. Petersburg. EHRI has also found that 14 other cities of the Russian Federation, mostly regional capitals or capitals of autonomous member-republics, have one State Archive and one Contemporary History Archive, which stems back to a former Communist Party Archive. EHRI has managed to provide collections descriptions for a number of these archives, which are located in Belgorod, Kaliningrad, Kaluga, Krasnodar, Kursk, Nalchik, Pskov, Rostov, Smolensk, Stavropol, Tula, Tver, Volgograd, Voronezh. EHRI has also identified and, in some cases, described collections in archival institutions in the following cities: Bryansk, Birobidzhan, Cherkessk, Elista, Maykop, Novgorod, Orel, Penza, Taganrog, Ust-Labinsk, Yeysk.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Russia, EHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections that are relevant to Holocaust research on Russia. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, for instance, holds selected records from a number of Russian Federation archives, both capital and regional. In Israel, Yad Vashem also holds significant documentation from archives in Russia and a huge quantity of sources pertaining to Jewish individuals and/or groups during the Holocaust period.\r\n",

                "history": "In 1939, the Kingdom of Sweden, a parliamentary democracy, declared it would stay neutral in case of a war between the European powers. Germany’s conquest of Denmark and Norway in 1940, however, pulled Sweden into the Third Reich’s military sphere of influence. In this position, Sweden was no longer able to pursue its policy of “active neutrality”.\r\n\r\nBefore 1939, Sweden had a total population of about 6,326,000 people. Approximately 7,000 of them were Jews. At least 900 more arrived as refugees from occupied Norway, when the Norwegian collaborationist government prepared for the deportation of the country’s Jews in 1942. Since the 1920´s the Swedish refugee policy had been very strict, but faced with growing evidence of deportations and mass murder of the European Jews, and especially the deportation of the Norwegian Jews in 1942, the Swedish Foreign Ministry shifted its stance on immigration. As a result, all Jews who fled to Sweden were granted asylum. In October 1943, after the Germans prepared to arrest the Danish Jews. More than 7,000 of them managed to escape to Sweden by way of an organised flight action by the Danish resistance movement, individuals and Swedish-Jewish organisations. The Swedish authorities had also, prior to the flight action, declared that the Danish Jews would be welcomed. In 1944, Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat, issued thousands of protective papers in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, thereby protecting more than 4,500 Jews. In early 1945, Sweden was able to secure the release of some Scandinavian and other concentration camp inmates. Through the international UN-organization UNRRA and the Swedish Red Cross approximately 20,000 survivors were brought to Sweden in different phases. At the end of the war, the Red Cross organized transports of 15,500 concentration camp prisoners to Sweden, with the White Buses Operation. Most of the survivors came from Norway and Denmark; approximately 4,000 of them were Jews. After the German capitulation in May 1945, an additional 9,000, mostly Poles and Hungarians, from different concentration camps were transported by the so-called White Boats to Sweden.\r\n\r\nIn 1930, a census counted 471 Roma, who were families of the Kalderaša and had immigrated to Sweden in the second half of the 19th century. At the same time, several thousand “Resande” (\"travellers\") lived in Sweden, whose origin went back to Roma who had immigrated in the 16th century. Roma were subject to discrimination; for example, the Riksdag had issued an entry ban on foreign Roma in 1914, which remained in force until 1954. Discussions about Roma as an alleged “racial problem” intensified during the Second World War and led to a census of 453 Roma carried out as part of a police raid on May 31, 1943; 7,668 Resande were separately recorded by 1944. Further measures were not taken because the State Institute for Racial Biology opposed them. In 1945, a small number of Roma and Sinti survivors were admitted to the country as part of the “White Buses” and “White Ships” rescue operations.",
                "summary": "EHRI has identified the Swedish National Archives, and several regional and city or municipal archives as important Holocaust-relevant collections holders. The Jewish community archives can also be found in the National Archives. Furthermore, the Military Archives of Sweden, university archives and libraries,  several museums and the Swedish labour movement’s Archives and Library hold sources pertaining to the Holocaust. A Swedish-language survey of Holocaust-related archives (see p. 243-276 in the following document: Sveriges museum om Förintelsen [https://www.regeringen.se/contentassets/03161ab08baa4461bb64b7ba1b25fd63/sveriges-museum-om-forintelsen-sou-202021.pdf]) has been integrated in Swedish and English into the EHRI Portal.  \r\n\r\nOutside of Sweden, EHRI has detected collections pertaining to Sweden and the Holocaust at the National Archives of Finland, at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Yad Vashem and Beit Terezin. EHRI has also discovered sources relevant to Sweden at the Hungarian National Archives and at the National Archives of Latvia.",

                "history": "Until the end of the First World War, Slovakia belonged to the Hungarian half of the Habsburg Monarchy. After 1918, it became a part of the Czechoslovak Republic. Following the Munich agreement of September 1938, Slovakia declared autonomy. A single-party regime came to power, with Jozef Tiso as prime minister. In November 1938, the country lost much of its southern territories to Hungary. At Germany’s instigation, the Slovak Parliament proclaimed independence on 14 March 1939, but remained bound to Germany by a “Protection Agreement”. In the fall of 1939 Jozef Tiso became president of Slovakia. Internally, Slovakia retained a considerable degree of autonomy, especially in its anti-Jewish policy. Slovakia served Germany as a concentration area before the Wehrmacht’s assault on Poland and joined Hitler’s war on the Soviet Union in 1941 as well. The rise and activities of underground groups in Slovakia in 1944 led to the country’s occupation by the German army and immediate break out of an anti-German (and anti-Regime) Slovak National Uprising on 29 August 1944. The uprising was suppressed in late October 1944. Occupied Slovakia was gradually liberated from Germans by the Red Army which entered and advanced on Slovakia from the east. With the Germans leaving the Slovak capital Bratislava in April 1945, the Slovak administration ceased to exist and Slovakia became a part of Czechoslovakia once more. In 1993, the separation of the Czech and Slovak Republics made Slovakia an independent state.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census, Slovakia had a total population of 3,324,111 people in 1930. 136,000 of them were Jews whose assimilation by Slovak society was tenuous. Many had declared Jewish nationality. There was also a strong Zionist movement while others gravitated towards Hungarian culture. Slovak Jews who lived in the southern part of the country, which was taken over by Hungary in 1938, later shared the history of Hungarian Jewry (by not having received Hungarian citizenship, they were actually the first ones to be deported or included in the Labour Battalions). There were 89,000 Jews left in independent Slovakia. The Slovak government engaged in the confiscation of Jewish property and adopted various anti-Jewish laws from the spring of 1939 to September 1941. These laws were thereupon aggregated and reinforced from September 1941 into a so-called Jewish Code emulating the German Nuremberg Laws in legalising the discrimination against Jews. The confiscation of Jewish property and discrimination of Jews led to the total pauperization of the Jewish population. In order to get rid of tens of thousands socially dependent Jews, the Slovak government first started to set up labour camps for Jews and then negotiated deportations of Jews from Slovakia into territory controlled by Nazi Germany. On 25 March 1942, the Slovak government started to deport the Slovak Jews to ghettos and death camps in occupied Poland. From March to late October 1942, about 58,000 Jews were deported there and the majority of them were murdered. About 20,000 Jews were excluded from deportation (among them the inmates of labour camps), and about 5,000 fled from Slovakia or went into hiding. In 1944 about 2,000 Jews took part in the Slovak National Uprising (some of them in Jewish units). After the collapse of the uprising, an additional 13,000 Jews were deported to German concentration camps. Overall, about 25,000 Slovak Jews survived the war whereas approximately 105,000 Slovakian Jews, including those in areas annexed by Hungary, perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nThe total number of Roma living on the territory of Slovakia before the Second World War is difficult to state accurately. According to contemporary data, more than 26,000 people claimed to be Roma on Slovak territory after the territorial losses in 1938. However, a certain proportion of Roma declared themselves to be members of the majority population or other minorities. In 1927, the Czechoslovak Republic enacted a law requiring all “itinerant” Roma to register with authorities allowing the government to enact punitive and discriminatory laws aimed at Roma. In 1939, a law was passed that stripped some of the Roma population of their citizenship. During the Second World War, Roma in Slovak territories faced forced labour and forced resettlement.  A concentration camp primarily for Roma was established in Dubnica nad Váhom. After the German occupation in 1944, more Roma were killed by German forces and members of the paramilitary organization of the  Hlinka's Slovak People's Party, and Roma communities were liquidated. In January 1945, an epidemic of typhus broke out in Dubnica, due to poor sanitary conditions and overpopulation. A quarantine was declared and it was forbidden to send any more Roma to the camp. Under the pretext of transporting them to the hospital, the sick Roma were loaded onto a truck and taken to the local arms factory where 26 of them were murdered. The murders of Roma also took place in other places such as Kremnička and Nemecká. ",
                "summary": "EHRI was able to establish that documents concerning the Second World War and the Holocaust can be found in the Slovak National Archive, regional state archives, but also in the Military History Archive, Nationʼs Memory Institute Archive, Holocaust Documentation Center and in the Museum of the Slovak National Uprising in Banská Bystrica.\r\n\r\nHolocaust-relevant sources on Slovakia have been identified by EHRI in institutions outside of the country, such as Beit Theresienstadt or the Jewish Museum in Prague, but also the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, which holds selected records from the Slovak National Archive and regional state archives, Slovak armed forces as well as numerous oral history interviews. Furthermore, Yad Vashem possesses a number of collections which are relevant to Holocaust-research on Slovakia. The Political Archive of the German Foreign Office and the Bundesarchiv also hold Holocaust-relevant records on Slovakia, for instance on the SD Slowakei.\r\n",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Slovakia: Pre-existing research, available archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Slovakia, EHRI could rely on the general finding aids available at the archives in Slovakia itself. Third party surveys on Holocaust-relates sources, such as the ones carried out by USHMM, were very helpful as well.  \r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Slovakia's archival system** \r\n\r\nSlovakia exhibits a centralized archival system in which the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak republic is in charge of the State archival system. The state archives are made up of the Slovak National Archive [Slovenský národný archív] in Bratislava as well as several regional State archives [Štátny archív v Bratislave, Štátny archív v Košiciach, Štátny archív v Prešove etc.] seated in county cities with their multiple branch archives (Workplace Archive) seated in district towns. Several other state archives and institutions have their own archival system and collections such as the Military History Archives [Vojenský historický archív], the Slovak National Museum Archive [Archív Slovenského národného múzea] and Archive of the Museum of the Slovak National Uprising [Múzeum Slovenského národného povstania].\r\nIn terms of access to state archival system, EHRI benefited from the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Ministry of Interior and the EHRI partner in Slovakia, the Holocaust Documentation Center. \r\nThe access to other state-funded archives was organized individually. Besides the state-funded collection holding institutions, EHRI also identified and integrated into the EHRI portal data on collections of two NGOs: Nadácia Milana Šimečku [Milan Šimečka Foundation] and the Holocaust Documentation Center which is also the EHRI partner in Slovakia. \r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results in Slovakia**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Slovakia**\r\n\r\nIn Slovakia, EHRI has identified several archival institutions which hold documents on Slovakia and the territory that was annexed by Hungary for the 1938-1945 period. For these institutions, EHRI has made over 150 top-level relevant archival descriptions available. In the Slovak National Archive, EHRI identified important fonds for the study of Slovakia’s Holocaust history, including the holdings of the Ministry of Interior, Central Economic Office, the Office of the President of the Slovak Republic, the Bureau of the Prime Minister´s Office of the Slovak Republic etc. These archival fonds cover the most important political decisions, administrative orders and reports issued by the Slovak authorities towards Jews and Roma in Slovakia in 1938-1945. In various regional state archives in Slovakia EHRI identified important archival fonds of Slovak and Hungarian state administration bodies and security forces active in the territory of Slovakia (1938-1945) and in the territories annexed by Hungary. \r\nEHRI also identified a significant number of Holocaust-relevant archival fonds created by retribution courts after 1945 (National Court, District People´s Courts, People´s Courts) all over Slovakia.\r\nIn the Military History Archives EHRI identified documents concerning military decisions covering mainly military forced labour of Jews. \r\n\r\nC.II. In other countries\r\n\r\nEHRI identified Holocaust-relevant sources on Slovakia outside of the country in several institutions, such as Beit Theresienstadt or the Jewish Museum in Prague. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum holds selected records from the Slovak National Archive and regional state archives, Slovak armed forces as well as numerous oral history interviews. Yad Vashem possesses a number of collections that are relevant to Holocaust-research on Slovakia. The Political Archive of the German Foreign Office and the Bundesarchiv also hold Holocaust-relevant records on Slovakia, for instance on the SD Slowakei. ",

                "extensive": "Disclaimer: The EHRI Extensive Report was updated in 2024.\r\n\r\n**A. EHRI approach to Austria: Pre-existing research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Austria, EHRI could rely on a number of pre-existing works on the Holocaust. Highly useful for EHRI’s identification efforts was a general overview of archives in Austria, Germany and Switzerland:\r\n\r\n[2009] *Archive in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz. Ein Adressenverzeichnis* (Münster: Ardey, 2009). Book + CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n[2023] *Archive in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz. Adressenverzeichnis 2023/2024* (Münster: Ardey, 2023). Book + CD-ROM\r\n\r\nThe publications of the Austrian Historians’ Commission [Österreichische Historikerkommission], which are available and searchable online at http://www.boehlau.at/histkom, are also helpful. Furthermore, the following platform is an important and specifically Holocaust-relevant online resource:\r\n\r\nNS-Quellen\r\nThis resource is dedicated to issues of expropriation between 1938 and 1945, and to issues of restitution and compensation after 1945. The platform itself is an entry point. Researchers will find detailed information about resources that can provide them with valuable assistance in their research (for example: In which Austrian archives can I find documents on expropriation? Where can I conduct research on citizenship revocation?; or how? How can I find out whether a specific property or rental was “aryanised”?). The platform offers an overview of the legal foundations of both the Nazi expropriation of property as well as restitution and compensation from the Republic of Austria after 1945. It gives direct access to the original texts of all the laws relevant to this context. There are also bibliographic references and explanations of individual terms. The information is in German. See here: (http://ns-quellen.at)\r\n\r\nInformation about further digital resources and services in Austria can be found on the website of EHRI Austria: https://www.ehri.at/en/projects/ \r\n\r\nAmong the more traditional research tools, the following guide is worth mentioning:\r\n[1995, 1991] Boberach, Heinz (Ed.), *Inventar archivalischer Quellen des NS-Staates. Die Überlieferung von Behörden und Einrichtungen des Reichs, der Länder und der NSDAP*, 2 Teile, (Munich: Saur, 1991, 1995). Also included in the commercial database “Deutsche Geschichte im 20. Jahrhundert Online: Nationalsozialismus, Holocaust, Widerstand und Exil 1933-1945”, http://db.saur.de/DGO.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Austrian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAustria exhibits a highly differentiated archival system without much centralisation. In addition to the Federal Archives and its departments (governed by the Bundesarchivgesetz), each of the Austrian Bundesländer has its own State Archive (each governed by the respective state Archivgesetz or statute). There are over 50 city archives. The religious communities in Austria, first and foremost bodies and organisations of the Catholic Church, exhibit a rich array of archival institutions. University archives, archives of noble houses (in particular the Liechtenstein archives) and a number of other, mostly topical archives as well as libraries holding archival material also exist.\r\n\r\nKey institutions identified by EHRI include the Austrian State Archive (Österreichisches Staatsarchiv/ Archiv der Republik), which has an online search engine (http://www.archivinformationssystem.at/suchinfo.aspx), and the respective state archives of the Austrian Bundesländer, which hold surviving files of central and regional administrative bodies as well as post-war investigations. Likewise important are the state operated Archive of the Mauthausen Memorial, which contains files of the Mauthausen concentration camp complex; the Dokumentationsarchiv des Österreichischen Widerstandes (DÖW), which contains material from private hands as well as serving as a hub for highly pertinent copied files accrued from dozens of archives; the Archive of the Jewish Community Vienna (Archiv der IKG Wien), which contains the files of the Vienna Jewish community encompassing the vast majority of Austrian Jews; the Vienna Wiesenthal Institute; for Holocaust Studies (VWI); and the Forschungsstelle Nachkriegsjustiz, which has collected the scattered information on post-war trials for Nazi war crimes.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Austria**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Austria**\r\n\r\nIn Austria, EHRI has identified over 200 state, municipal and church archives. While well over 25% of these archives are clustered in or around Vienna, there are also important archives in all Austrian Bundesländer.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Austria, material relevant to the Holocaust in Austria can be found in a number of institutions, including the German Bundesarchiv and the Arolsen Archives in Germany, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University, Yad Vashem, the Central Archive of the Jewish People in Jerusalem, the Wiener Holocaust Library in London, the Leo Baeck Institute in Jerusalem, New York/Berlin, and London, the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam as well as the National Archives of Hungary and the Hungarian Jewish Archives in Budapest, the Historical Jewish Institute in Warsaw, and the Jewish Museum in Prague.

Renamed the Archives of Bosnia-Herzegovina, they hold, conserve, process and enable the use of archives and current records of state bodies, state and public institutions as well as enterprises and corporate bodies, families and persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The main branch is in Sarajevo; there are also district (canton/county) archives located in several major administrative centers around the country: Sarajevo, Brčko, Bihać, Travnik, Tuzla, Goražde, Široki Brijeg and Mostar. The Archives of Bosnia-Herzegovina are not to be confused with the Archive of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina [Arhiv Federacije Bosne i Hercegovine], which was established in 1994 (also located in Sarajevo) and does not contain Holocaust-relevant collections. The Archive of Republika Srpska [Arhiv Republike Srpske] is another entity-level archival institution, located in Banja Luka (with several departments, located in Doboj, Foča, Trebinje and Zvornik). The country’s archival holdings have suffered, to a certain extent, from the war fought on its territory between 1991 and 1995, but also from recent events. For instance, the National and University Library, housed by Sarajevo's City Hall since 1949/50, was bombed and the resulting fire destroyed an estimated 80 percent of the Library’s collections. Meanwhile, the building has been restored and recently reopened. Furthermore, the National Archives of Bosnia were affected by riots; in 2014 collections of the so-called Depot 1, which contain, among other materials, sources on the investigation of war crimes committed on Bosnian territory during the Second World War, were partially damaged or destroyed.",
                "summary": "In Bosnia and Herzegovina, EHRI has identified a helpful guide which contains general information about Bosnian archives:\r\n\r\n- Bakaršić, Kemal, *Fragmenti kulturne historije Bosne i Hercegovine* (Sarajevo: Magistrat, 2005)\r\n\r\nSeveral archival institutions in the country have guides offering details about their collections but they are rarely available in English. More importantly, EHRI has identified several repositories relevant for Holocaust research, and described over 60 collections in this country. The Archives of Bosnia-Herzegovina can be considered the most important institution to hold Holocaust-relevant material in the country, as they have a vast collection from the Second World War period and from the Research Commission of Crimes Committed by Occupying Forces. Furthermore, the Jewish Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina [Muzej Jevreja Bosne i Hercegovine], which is a branch of the Museum of Sarajevo [Muzej Sarajevo], and the Historical Archives Sarajevo [Historijski arhiv Sarajevo] have documents concerning the Holocaust. Other archives and institutions in the country which are likely to be relevant for Holocaust research are the Jewish Community of Sarajevo, the Tuzla County Archives [Arhiv Tuzlanskog kantona] and Archives of Republika Srpska, among others.\r\n\r\nOutside of Bosnia and Herzegovina, certain Croatian archives, such as the Croatian State Archive in Zagreb and Osijek, may have further relevant material. In Serbia, the Jewish Historical Museum [Jevrejski istorijski muzej] in Belgrade holds significant amount of material pertaining to the Holocaust period in Bosnia. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) offers a number of relevant oral history interviews, and repositories in Germany and Italy are very likely to have collections pertaining to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\n",

Sources that were particularly relevant to EHRI’s survey work include the following monographs: Anisa Hasanhnodžić, Rifet Rustemović, *After the traces of our neighbours: Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Holocaust* (Sarajevo: Institut za istoriju, 2015); Rusmir Agačević, *Snovopriče o Sefardima i Aškenazima travničkim* (Zagreb, 2013); Jakov Danon, Verica M. Stošić, *Memoari na holokaust Jevreja Bosanske krajine* (Banja Luka, Arhiv Republike Srpske, 2009); Aleksandar Gaon (ed.), *Mi smo preživeli…: Jevreji o holokaustu* (Beograd, 2001-2007); Avram Pinto, *Jevreji Sarajeva i Bosne i Hercegovine* (Sarajevo:Veselin Masleša, 1987); Jaša Romano, *Jevreji Jugoslavije 1941-1945. Žrtve genocida i učesnici Narodnooslobodilačkog rata* (Belgrade, Jevrejski istorijski muzej, 1980); Eli Tauber, *Kako se sporovodio holokaust u Bosni i Hercegovini* (Sarajevo, 2012), Eli Tauber, *When neighbours were real human beings* (Sarajevo, Jevrejska zajednica, 2010). EHRI also relied on dozens of written articles published in several journals (*Most, Baština sjeveroistočne Bosne, Jevrejski pregled, Jevrejski glas, Sefarad 92*, etc.), memoirs and previously conducted surveys and copies of relevant documentation performed by third parties, mainly by the USHMM, are also useful. EHRI has also identified a helpful guide which contains general information about Bosnian archives:\r\n\r\n- Bakaršić, Kemal, *Fragmenti kulturne historije Bosne i Hercegovine* (Sarajevo: Magistrat, 2005).\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s archival system**\r\n\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina has a heavily decentralized political structure that is reflected in its archival system as well. The central archival institution, the Archives of Bosnia-Herzegovina, is located in Sarajevo, the capital city. The majority of relevant records for Holocaust research are stored there, but the institution has no control over other archives in the country. There are two provincial (entity’s) archives, the “Archive of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina”, which does not hold Holocaust-related material, and “Archive of Republika Srpska,” which operate in their respective political entities, which were formed by the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995. Besides them, there is an archive in the District of Brčko. As with the Archive of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Brčko archives does not hold Holocaust-related material. The Archive of Republika Srpska has several branches, but it operates as a centralized institution, with headquarters in Banja Luka. Moreover, the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, besides having its archival institution, also has cantonal (county) archives. These archives operate in most of the cantons (Travnik, Široki Brijeg, Bihać, Mostar, Tuzla, Goražde, Sarajevo). However, these institutions are independent and work under their own, cantonal laws. This heavily decentralized archival system can sometimes be a hindrance to efficient research. It is also worth noting that most of the archives are still in development, which can further delay research and availability of records.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Bosnia and Herzegovina**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Bosnia and Herzegovina**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified a number of archival institutions and other types of organisations which hold Holocaust-relevant documents and has described over 60 collections. The Archives of Bosnia-Herzegovina are the most important institution in possession of Holocaust-relevant material as they hold a vast collection from the Second World War period and from the Research Commission of Crimes Committed by Occupying Forces. Furthermore, the Jewish Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina [Muzej Jevreja Bosne i Hercegovine], which is a branch of the Museum of Sarajevo [Muzej Sarajevo], the Historical Archives Sarajevo [Historijski arhiv Sarajevo] and the archives of Jewish communities (Sarajevo, Doboj, Mostar and others) have documents that are relevant for Holocaust research. The collections and fonds of these institutions cover a broad range of documentation, but they mostly contain administrative, political and judicial documentation created by authorities (local or higher levels), organizations, military structures, etc.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Bosnia and Herzegovina, EHRI was able to identify a significant number of Holocaust-related collections at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, which holds selected records from several Bosnian archives (Travnik, Tuzla, Sarajevo), individuals and communities. Relevant material can also be found in other former Yugoslav countries, namely, Serbia and Croatia. The Jewish Museum in Belgrade (Serbia) and the Croatian State Archives (in Zagreb) contain numerous collections related to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Jews and the Holocaust.",

                "situation": "The National Archives of Belgium and the State Archives in the Provinces, known simply as the State Archives, are a federal academic establishment that forms part of the Belgium Federal Science Policy Office. The institution includes the National Archives in Brussels, which holds the records of the various national/federal Ministries (including the Foreigner Police), and 17 State Archives, which are distributed throughout the country. In 2016, the Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary (CEGESOMA), was integrated into the State Archives. Founded in 1969, this federal research and documentation centre holds important Holocaust-related collections. The Directorate-General for War Victims, another important organisation, is part of the Federal Public Service for Social Security. In 2018, the Archives and Documentation section of the Directorate-General for War Victims was also integrated into the State Archives. In addition to these official archives, there are also collections in private archives and museums including, Kazerne Dossin: Memorial, Museum and Research Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights, which is located in the buildings of the former transit camp Dossin in Mechelen, the Jewish Museum of Belgium, the Auschwitz Foundation, and the Foundation of Contemporary Memory.\r\n",
                "summary": "EHRI has identified a number of helpful publications and archival guides on Belgium (see the extensive report). At the same time as EHRI had started its identification and investigation work, the National Archives of Belgium commenced a project which aimed to produce a guide to sources on Jewish life in Belgium. EHRI closely cooperated with this project’s directors and researchers. The identification of repositories holding Holocaust-related collections dramatically improved thanks to this collaborative identification work. \r\n\r\nOne of the most important Belgian archives for Holocaust research is Kazerne Dossin: Memorial, Museum and Research Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights. This museum and research centre actively collects material, often private collections, about the Holocaust in Belgium. It holds the largest collection of materials on the topic in Belgium, including original, photocopied and scanned materials. EHRI supported Kazerne Dossin by helping them transfer the existing texts into archival descriptions according to international archival standards and integrating new descriptions into this system. This resulted in a major step forward for Kazerne Dossin: from 17 collection descriptions, Kazerne Dossin now provides EHRI with hundreds of descriptions. It is continuing this effort in order to make all its materials publicly available on a collection level.\r\n\r\nMade up of the National Archives, 17 State Archives in the Provinces, the Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (CEGESOMA); and the Directorate-General for War Victims, the State Archives are another significant institution that hold Holocaust-related material. In particular, the National Archives branch in Brussels conserve the archive of the former Military Justice system, which includes all the post-war trial records. Some important city (and communal) archives also have Holocaust-related material, such as those of Brussels, Antwerp, Liège, Charleroi and Ghent. Moreover, EHRI has worked closely CEGESOMA. Collection descriptions from the Centre were selected via key-word selection and literature search (verification of bibliographies of key works on the Holocaust in Belgium) and integrated onto the Portal by EHRI. This export includes archival documents, manuscripts, interview descriptions, and photo descriptions. As for the Directorate-General for War Victims, it possesses one of the largest and most important collections on the Holocaust in Belgium from the victims’ perspective.\r\n\r\nThere are also several important private archival institutions in Belgium. Notably, the Jewish Museum of Belgium in Brussels, which holds important sources related to the victims, as do some remembrance organisations, such as the Auschwitz Foundation and the Foundation of Contemporary Memory, which collect testimonies.\r\n\r\nMany other sources are stored in repositories outside of Belgium. First of all, there are the archives of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (with branches in New York and Jerusalem) and the World Jewish Congress records on Belgium (stored at the Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati). The Yad Vashem archives hold both original and copied materials on Jews in Belgium, including the original documents of the Belgian Jewish Committee in London during the Second World War. Likewise, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum holds vast materials on Jews in Belgium, both originals and copies. Their copy collection on Belgium includes copies from Kazerne Dossin, the Directorate-General for War Victims, CEGESOMA, and the National Archives (Foreigners’ Police archives, Brüsseler Treuhandgesellschaft collection, Archive of the Diamond collection and other files). The USHMM’s original collections include the “Fela and Chaïm Perelman papers”. The extensive report on Belgium also includes references to publications on sources on Belgium stored in German and French archives (most notably, the German sources on Belgium kept at the French National Archives at Pierrefitte-sur-Seine, the sub-series AJ40, and those kept at the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv Freiburg).",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Belgium: Pre-existing research and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nTwo official research projects, commissioned by the Belgian State, that have been carried out by CEGESOMA and others, have mapped a significant proportion of Holocaust-related archives in Belgium. The first project, conducted in 2001, was about the spoliation of Jewish assets during the war. The second, the results of which were published in 2007, investigated the possible responsibility of Belgian national and local authorities in the persecution of the Jews. The major publications resulting from these projects were:\r\n\r\n- *Les biens des victims des persécutions anti-juives en Belgique: spoliation, rétablissement des droits, résultats de la Commission d’étude. / De bezittingen van de slachtoffers van de jodenvervolging in België: spoliatie, rechtsherstel, bevindingen van de studiecommissie: eindverslag*, Brussels: Chancellery of the Prime Minister, July 2001\r\n\r\n- Rudi Van Doorslaer (dir), Emmanuel Debruyne, Frank Seberechts, Nico Wouters (a.l.p.d. Lieven Saerens), *La Belgique docile. Les autorités belges et la persécution des juifs en Belgique durant la Seconde guerre mondiale*, Brussel, Luc Pire/Ceges, 2007, 2 vol., 1,545 p. / Rudi Van Doorslaer (red.), Emmanuel Debruyne, Frank Seberechts, Nico Wouters (i.s.m. Lieven Saerens), *Gewillig België. Overheid en Jodenvervolging tijdens de Tweede Wereldoorlog*, Antwerpen/Brussel, Meulenhoff-Manteau/Soma, 2007, 1,163 p.\r\n\r\nAt the same time as EHRI had started its identification and investigation work, the National Archives of Belgium commenced a project which aimed to produce a guide to sources on Jewish life in Belgium. EHRI closely cooperated with the directors of the project at the National Archives and the two project researchers, Gertjan Desmet and Pascale Falek Alhadeff. The major publication resulting from this project was:\r\n\r\n- Pierre-Alain Tallier (dir.), Gertjan Desmet & Pascale Falek-Alhadeff, *Sources pour l'histoire des populations juives et du judaïsme en Belgique/Bronnen voor de geschiedenis van de Joden en het Jodendom in België, 19de-21ste eeuw*, Brussel, ARA-AGR/Avant-Propos, 2016, 1,328 p.\r\n\r\nBefore the publication of this guide, no such archival overview existed, although there were other synopses available that dealt with periodicals and publications on Jewish history (and in the case of the latter, indirectly shed light on certain primary sources, although its main focus was on secondary sources):\r\n\r\n- Zosa Szajkowski. “Bibliography of Jewish Periodicals in Belgium, 1841–1959”, *Studies in Bibliography and Booklore*, Vol. 4, No. 3 (June 1960), pp. 103-122 (Published by: Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion; Article Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/27943319).\r\n\r\n- Daniel Dratwa. *Répertoire des périodiques juifs parus en Belgique de 1841 à 1986*, Brussels: Pro Museo Judaico, 1987.\r\n\r\n- Barbara Dickschen — Jacques Déom — Catherine Massange — Jean-Philippe Schreiber, *Guide Bibliographique: Les Juifs en Belgique*, Brussels, Fondation de la Mémoire Contemporaine-Stichting Eigentijdse Herinnering, 2008 [updated version in 2014].\r\n\r\nIn addition to the works mentioned above, EHRI’s identification work relied on many other publications on the Holocaust in Belgium as well as other archival guides (none of which were entirely dedicated to Holocaust sources). For a general introduction to sources on Belgian contemporary history, see:\r\n\r\n- Patricia Van den Eeckhout & Guy Vanthemsche (eds.), *Bronnen voor de studie van het hedendaagse België, 19e-21e eeuw* (Brussels: Koninklijke Commissie voor Geschiedenis / Commission royale d'Histoire, 2017, 3rd revised edition).\r\n\r\nFor finding aids on sources on Belgium during the Second World War in German and French archives, see:\r\n\r\n- Stefan Martens & Sebastian Remus, *Frankreich und Belgien unter deutscher Besatzung 1940-1944; die Bestände des Bundesarchiv-Militärarchivs Freiburg* (Stuttgart: Jan Thorbecke Verlag, 2002).\r\n\r\n- Guy Beaujouan, Anne-Marie Bourgoin, Pierre Cézard, et.al., *La France et la Belgique sous l'occupation allemande, 1940-1944. Les fonds allemands conservés au Centre historique des Archives nationales. Inventaire de la sous-série AJ40* (Paris: Centre historique des Archives nationales, 2002).\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Belgian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nBelgium has a large number of repositories, considering the size of the country, and they are a mixture of public and private initiatives. This means researchers can sometimes find them hard to navigate. When looking for basic information about victims, local and national administrations are often in possession of personal files. The majority of Jews in Belgium were not Belgian nationals (less than 10 percent at the registration in 1940). For the non-naturalized legal residents the Belgian Foreigners’ Police kept personal or family files. These files are held in both local level institutions (the city administrations) and in the National Archives (central files). It is important to note that the Jewish communities in Belgium were concentrated in Brussels and Antwerp, and to a far lesser extent in Charleroi and Liège. Following the decree from 29 August 1942, Jews were only allowed to live in one of these four cities. But still there are interesting sources in other city archives. The case of the deportation of a few thousand Jews from Antwerp to communities in the adjacent province of Limburg at the end of 1940 illustrates this. They were allowed to return after a few months, but their stay obviously left traces in some of the local archives. These archives can be identified using (local) studies on this very specific subject, but these are very small archives with sometimes very limited collections on the Holocaust period. The foreigners’ files are accessible via name registers, organised according to date of arrival in Belgium. It should be noted that public administrations in Belgium were (and are still) not allowed to register ethnic or religious background. None of the official pre- or post-war sources therefore mention “Jew” or “Jewishness” (unlike in the neighbouring Netherlands, for example, where religion was duly registered).\r\n\r\nIndeed, this access via names – instead of, for example, by topic – poses one of the most important challenges to locating both victim and perpetrator sources in Belgium. Important victim sources are held by the Directorate-General War for Victims, a state institution, originally founded by the Ministry of Reconstruction and now part of the State Archives. Its task was to gather information on war victims in different military archives, judicial archives, etc., in order to obtain settlement and/or victim recognition. It thus built up a huge collection of personal files and files on some organisations, such as the Jewish resistance. There is no online catalogue, only a card index system which is not publicly accessible. It is alphabetically ordered, so one has to know the name of the person whose files he or she is looking for and there are no specific references to the persecution of the Jews. There is also an inventory, but using it does not resolve the issues mentioned above.\r\n\r\nSimilar problems arise in the case of one the most important archives for the study of the perpetrators. The archives of the former Military Justice system, which hold the files of the post-war trials of war criminals and collaborators, have been transferred to the National Archives but are not publicly accessible, consultation requiring the authorisation of the *Collège des procureurs généraux/College van procureurs-generaal*. Access is generally granted for researchers, the individuals concerned and their descendants. A research guide and summary finding aid exist.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Belgium**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Belgium**\r\n\r\nEHRI's identification and investigation work in Belgium was based on a three-pronged approach:\r\n\r\n1. Actively identifying repositories (and collections, in the case of CEGESOMA) via the bibliographies of key publications on the subject.\r\n\r\n2. Providing Kazerne Dossin – Memorial, Museum and Documentation Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights with know-how and assistance to provide shareable descriptions of its sources that meet international archival standards.\r\n\r\n3. Working closely together with the authors and directors of the research guide on *Sources pour l'histoire des populations juives et du judaïsme en Belgique/Bronnen voor de geschiedenis van de Joden en het Jodendom in België, 19de-21ste eeuw*\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the identification of repositories holding Holocaust-related collections was dramatically improved by EHRI’s identification work, both via its own identification work based on the abovementioned reference works and through cooperation with the National Archives and their research guide authors. At the start of EHRI, the Directory of Holocaust-Related Archives of the Claims Conference listed 7 Belgian archives while the *Guide éuropeen des sources d’archives de la Shoah* provided information on 9 repositories. EHRI's portal now contains information on over 120 repositories, most of them with detailed information.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the huge gap that had to be covered has much to do with the belated interest in Holocaust documentation and research in Belgium. CEGESOMA was created in the late 1960s, which is rather late compared to similar institutions in other countries, such as NIOD in the Netherlands. Moreover, although the persecution of Jews during the Second World War was always present both in the collections and in research, it was never a central focus point. This delayed interest was very much visible when EHRI started its activities. EHRI's activities coincided with the beginnings of a research guide to Jewish sources at the National Archives, and the opening of Kazerne Dossin, so the project started precisely at a time when the topic was finally receiving wide attention in Belgium from academic, archival and public perspectives.\r\n\r\n**_Identification of collections_**\r\n\r\n*Kazerne Dossin*\r\n\r\nDue to the aforementioned challenges, the first point of call of any research on the persecution of Jews in Belgium should be Kazerne Dossin. Kazerne Dossin was originally established in the mid-1990s as the Jewish Museum of Deportation and Resistance and was located in the former transit camp Dossin in Mechelen. This museum and research centre actively collects material, often private collections, related to the Holocaust in Belgium. It holds the largest collection of materials on the topic in Belgium, including original, photocopied and scanned materials. Often, Kazerne Dossin can offer easier access to originals kept elsewhere, as it has, first of all, such a wide variety of sources in one central place and, secondly, because its database can trace multiple sources on one person, thereby giving easy access to scanned foreigners’ files on victims of the Holocaust (whereas in the original archives one would have to go through the register and then request the file needed, or search for the correct microfilm) or other sources. Consulting these sources in the original repository, would require considerable effort in terms of administration and identification. Moreover, Kazerne Dossin keeps track of ongoing research and employs a team of experts in the field.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite the wealth of its sources, the archives of Kazerne Dossin remained relatively unknown to the outside world until 2015 because of the limited information available via finding aids. On its website, Kazerne Dossin originally only provided one text describing its main collections, which was regularly updated: The number of described collections fluctuated between 9 and 17 and the identifier numbers attached to the collection descriptions changed. Many of the materials – often precious private sources from victims or survivors, donated to the museum – remained hidden behind generic descriptions such as “Museum’s collection” or were only described in a separate Word document, stored in a folder together with the scans of the originals and only accessible to staff. EHRI supported Kazerne Dossin by helping them transfer the existing texts into archival descriptions according to international archival standards, and integrate new descriptions into this system. This resulted in a major step forward for Kazerne Dossin: the number of collection descriptions provided to EHRI rose from 17 to over 220 descriptions and Kazerne Dossin is continuing its efforts to make all its materials publicly available on a collection level. As one of the archivists stated: “It is only since EHRI came along that people here accepted the need to work according to international archival standards”.\r\n\r\n*CEGESOMA*\r\n\r\nThe Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (CEGESOMA) also holds important Holocaust collections, such as as the archives of the Devisenschutzkommando, the records of the trial against von Falkenhausen, the Tätigkeitsberichte of the Military Administration and important files from the former Military Prosecutor's Office. Collection descriptions from CEGESOMA were selected via keyword selection and literature search (verification of bibliographies of key works on the Holocaust in Belgium) and integrated by EHRI's IT specialists. The export includes archival documents, manuscripts, interview descriptions, and photo descriptions.\r\n\r\n*Sources pour l'histoire des populations juives et du judaïsme en Belgique/Bronnen voor de geschiedenis van de Joden en het Jodendom in België, 19de-21ste eeuw*\r\n\r\nThis archival guide was analysed and the descriptions relevant to the EHRI project, both in Belgium and abroad, were selected and added to the EHRI portal.\r\n\r\n**C.II.In other countries**\r\n\r\nMany sources are stored in repositories outside of Belgium. First of all, there are the archives of the JDC (with branches in New York and Jerusalem) and of the World Jewish Congress records on Belgium (stored at the Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati). Original documents of the Belgian Jewish Committee in London during the Second World War are available at Yad Vashem (M.22). This committee, founded in 1943 in London by Herman Schamisso, unified a group of Belgian Jewish exiles in London. Their records contain correspondence with various Jewish institutions in Belgium, England, the US and elsewhere. They also contain correspondence with the Belgian government-in-exile about ways of assisting Jews in Belgium and Jews from Belgium in exile abroad. Furthermore, the records include lists of deportees and survivors. In addition to this rich collection, Yad Vashem has both original and copied documents on Jews in Belgium, including on Jewish resistance (M.64, 0.29, 0.44). There are also indirect sources on Jews in Belgium, such as “Documentation regarding the Holocaust from the Central Archives in Moscow, 1939-1945” (M.40) and “Documentation of the Central British Fund” (M.56).\r\n\r\nUSHMM also holds vast materials, both originals and copies, on Jews in Belgium. Their copy collection on Belgium includes copies from Kazerne Dossin, the Directorate-General War for Victims, CEGESOMA, and the National Archives (Foreigners’ Police, *Brüsseler Treuhandgesellschaft* collection, Archive of the Diamond collection and other files). A non-exhaustive list of the copies includes: selected records from the Belgian War Crimes Tribunals and Investigation Records, selected records from the Ministry of Reconstruction of Belgium, selected records from the Belgian Royal Archives, selected records related to the Pierre Beeckmans Anti-Jewish organisation in Belgium, selected records from the City of Liège and from the *Consistoire Central Israélite de Belgique*, and records relating to the Breendonk camp. The original collections include the “Fela and Chaïm Perelman papers” (Acc.nr. 2006.432). Chaïm Perelman (a very influential philosopher in the fields of the philosophy of law and argumentation) founded the \"*Comité de Défense des Juifs*\", the Jewish underground in Belgium. Both Chaïm and Fela worked for the underground during the war. Fela opened a kindergarten called \"Nos Petits\" in 1942 and when the school closed she made efforts to hide Jewish children.\r\n\r\nGerman sources on Belgium during the Second World War are stored at, among other places, the French National Archives at Pierrefitte-sur-Seine (sub-series AJ40), and the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv Freiburg.\r\n\r\n",

Outside of Bulgaria, relevant material from the Holocaust-period can be found in a number of institutions. EHRI was able to identify, among other institutions, the German Bundesarchiv in Berlin Lichterfelde and in Freiburg, the Politisches Archiv des Auswärtigen Amtes, and Yad Vashem in Israel. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has copied a considerable quantity of Holocaust-relevant archival material from Bulgaria based on the collection of the Archives State Agency.

EHRI approach to Bulgaria: Pre-existing research and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nDocumentary databases (resources) regarding the history of Jews in Bulgaria exist in Yad Vashem, USHMM, Centropa and, most of all, in the Bulgarian Archives State Agency and many other archival institutions in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Bulgarian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nBulgaria has a centralised archival system. The state archival institution has changed its name and departmental subordination several times. Now known as the Archives State Agency, its current status is regulated by National Archival Fonds Act, which was adopted in 2007. The organisation of and procedures governing access to the archival records are regulated by the [Law on the National Archival Fonds](http://www.archives.government.bg/images/1279111646.doc), the [Regulation on the procedures for use the records of the National Archival Fonds](http://www.archives.government.bg/uploaded_files/Regulation_USE__EN.pdf) and the [Rules for the procedures and organization of the archival records' use in Archives State Agency (ASA)](http://www.archives.government.bg/uploaded_files/Rules-order_and_organization_of_the_use.doc). All Bulgarian and foreign physical and juridical persons may use the records held by the ASA. The structure of the ASA includes a central archive and six directorates in the regional centres of Burgas, Varna, Tarnovo, Plovdiv, Montana and Sofia. Under them are all the other 27 regional archival branches of ASA. Several other archival institutions contain documents concerning the fate of Jews in Bulgaria during the Second World War. These are the State Military Historical Archives in the city of Veliko Turnovo, the Sofia City Archive, the Archive of the Bulgarian Academy of Science, as well archives in other countries. The most significant collections outside Bulgaria can be found in Yad Vashem, USHMM and different archives in Germany and Russia. The most important information for all future researchers is the expanding digital access to huge collection of archival documents concerning the fate of the Jews in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Bulgaria**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Bulgaria**\r\n\r\nThe Central State Archives and the regional archives hold different collections connected to the persecution and protection of the Bulgarian Jews during the Second World War as well as the deportation of the Macedonian and Thracian Jews. The biggest and most important among them are the record groups of the Commissariat for the Jewish Affairs. All archives are open to researchers and users. The entire collection is in the process of digitisation. Digital open access is provided, and referred to in the EHRI archival descriptions. Given the huge volume of documents, EHRI’s main aim for Bulgaria has been to present up-to-date and accurate information on the structure of the archives, contacts, logistical information, as well as a description of the volume of documents and a general content description of the main branches of the State Agency Archives and of the Central State Archives itself. EHRI has been able to provide up-to-date summaries of the structure of the fonds, the quantities of documents, as well as descriptions of a small number of representative archival units in these inventories. For example, the Fonds of Commissariat of Jewish Affairs [Комисарство по еврейските въпроси – КЕВ], which is available at the State Archives Agency, contains 15,348 archival units organised in three inventories. The EHRI portal includes links to the Archives State Agency for a number of digitized documents concerning the persecution and protection of Jews in Bulgaria during the Second World War.\r\n\r\n**C.II. Outside of Bulgaria**\r\n\r\nEHRI was able to identify, among other institutions, the German Bundesarchiv in Berlin Lichterfelde and Freiburg, the Politisches Archiv des Auswärtigen Amtes, and Yad Vashem in Israel. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has copied a considerable quantity of Holocaust-relevant archival material from Bulgaria based on the collection of the State Agency Archives.

                "summary": "EHRI has identified a number of helpful archival guides on Belarus, some of which are available online. A list is provided in the EHRI extensive report on Belarus. EHRI established contact with central Belarusian archival authorities to facilitate future exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in the country.\r\n\r\nThe most important Belarusian archives for Holocaust research include the National Archives of the Republic of Belarus. Their collections cover German occupation organizations, Communist Party and Partisan organization files as well as the post-Liberation investigations of the Belarusian Extraordinary State Committee to Investigate German Fascist Crimes Committed on Soviet Territory. Similar files of a more local provenance are contained in the Regional Archives in Viciebsk, Mahilioŭ, Homiel, Hrodna and, most importantly, Brest, where larger collections containing material of Jewish origin also exist. EHRI has identified over 25 archival institutions in Belarus which hold Holocaust-relevant material. Seven of them are located in the country’s capital Minsk. For a complete list, see the EHRI extensive report on Belarus.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there are regional, “zonal” or otherwise specialized archives with Holocaust-relevant collections which can be found in 14 urban centers of Belarus, namely in Baranavičy, Babrujsk, Barysaŭ, Brest, Hlybokaje, Homiel, Kobryn, Lida, Mazyr, Orša, Pinsk, Polack, Rečyca and Viciebsk. They are also listed in the EHRI extensive report on Belarus. Based on a published finding aid, EHRI has identified over 230 collections spread over several repositories.\r\n\r\nOutside of Belarus, EHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections that may prove relevant to Holocaust research on Belarus, for instance in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Russia. In Israel, Yad Vashem holds significant documentation from archives in Belarus from 1930 to 1960, containing over 4,000 files. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum stores selected records from the Belarus Central State Archives and from the Homiel, Hrodna and Mahilioŭ regional archives.\r\n",

EHRI approach to Belarus: Pre-existing research, available archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nEHRI’s exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in Belarus relied on some important pre-existing research in the field, such as Christian Gerlach’s *Kalkulierte Morde. Die deutsche Wirtschafts- und Vernichtungspolitik in Weißrußland 1941-1944* (1998), which had already made use of archival material available in the country. EHRI was also able to identify a number of helpful archival guides, some of which are available online.\r\n\r\nFor a general overview, which is also available in English, see:\r\n\r\nhttp://archives.gov.by/eng\r\n\r\nMore specialised archival guides include:\r\n\r\n- [2007] Stefan Karner & Vjačeslav Selemenev (Hg.), *Österreicher und Sudetendeutsche vor sowjetischen Militär- und Strafgerichten in Weißrussland 1945–1950* (Graz – Minsk, 2007).

Characteristics of the Belarusian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nMost of the central and regional Belarusian archives were founded during the pre-war Soviet period and suffered, to some extent, from fighting, evacuation or occupation. A smaller number of archival institutions was created and began to operate immediately after the German occupiers’ withdrawal from Belarus. There are also some more recently established archival institutions. As a result of regime changes and administrative reforms, many archival institutions in Belarus have been repeatedly renamed, which may cause some initial confusion among researchers.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Belarus**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Belarus**\r\n\r\nIn Belarus, EHRI identified over 25 archival institutions which hold or may hold Holocaust-relevant material on Belarus. Many of them are concentrated in the country’s capital, Minsk, and environs. Among the numerous provincial centres, the cities of Hrodna and Mahilioŭ each host two Holocaust-relevant archival institutions. Regional, zonal and otherwise specialised archives can be found in all other urban centres of Belarus, i.e. in Baranavičy (Baranovichi), Babrujsk (Bobruisk), Barysaŭ (Borisov), Brest, Dziaržynsk (Dzerzhinsk), Hlybokaje (Glubokoe), Homiel (Gomel), Kobryn (Kobrin), Lida, Mazyr (Mozyr), Orša (Orsha), Pinsk, Polack (Polotsk), Rečyca (Rechitsa) and Viciebsk (Vitebsk).\r\n\r\nThe abovementioned Belarusian archives hold vast numbers of valuable records on all conceivable aspects of the country’s general history: the Minsk-based National Archives alone stores about 1,200 fonds, and almost all regional or zonal archives hold similarly impressive numbers of collections. Given the dimension of mass murder in Belarus during the Second World War, many Holocaust-relevant collections are either known to be stored or can be expected to be found in the country’s archives. On the basis of Sergej V Zumar’s *Dokumente zur Geschichte des Zweiten Weltkrieges in den Staatsarchiven der Republik Belarus. Ein Nachschlagewerk / Dokumenty po istorii Velikoi Otechestvennoi voiny v gosudarstvennykh arkhivach Respubliki Belarus* (2003), EHRI has selected Holocaust-relevant collections among the general mass of sources in Belarus. The descriptions of these selected collections have been copied from the Belarusian online archival catalogue (http://fk.archives.gov.by/catalogue/).\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Belarus, EHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections that may prove relevant to Holocaust research on Belarus, for instance in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Russia. In Israel, Yad Vashem holds a significant documentation from archives in Belarus from 1930 to 1960, containing over 4,000 files.

Specifically, EHRI notes that Holocaust-related materials can be found at the Alex Dworkin Canadian Jewish Archives in Montreal, as well as at the Jewish Public Library Archives of Montreal, the Montreal Holocaust Museum, the Ontario Jewish Archives in Toronto, and the Vancouver Holocaust Education Centre. The EHRI Portal provides archival descriptions for material held by the Alex Dworkin Canadian Jewish Archives, the Jewish Public Library, the Ottawa Jewish Archives, and the Vancouver Holocaust Education Centre, including Jewish immigrants’ personal papers and the Yom Hashoah Holocaust Remembrance Committee (formerly the Warsaw Ghetto Committee) fonds.

                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Germany: Pre-existing research and archival guides**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Germany, research on the Holocaust has been conducted worldwide and for decades now. It follows that a full and up-to-date account of the available literature cannot be given here. However, a reference to the 16-volume series *Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der europäischen Juden durch das nationalsozialistische Deutschland 1933-1945* is appropriate, especially volumes 1-16 (published 2008-2018). This series is co-published by EHRI-partner Institute for Contemporary History Munich-Berlin [Institut für Zeitgeschichte München-Berlin, IfZ]. All volumes contain introductions based on international research. A translation of the series into English under the title *The Persecution and Murder of European Jews by Nazi Germany, 1933–1945* is under preparation with the cooperation of Yad Vashem; Volume 1-5, 12 were published in 2019-2022. Furthermore, there is the series Benz, Wolfgang / Distel, Barbara, *Der Ort des Terrors. Geschichte der nationalsozialistischen Konzentrationslager*, Volumes 1-9.\r\n\r\nResearch on the genocide of the Sinti and Roma began late; the most important and comprehensive publication to date is Michael Zimmermann's habilitation: *Rassenutopie und Genozid. Die nationalsozialistische Lösung der Zigeunerfrage*, Hamburg: Christians 1996 (available online at https://zeitgeschichte-hamburg.de/publikation-detail/band-33.html). Since summer 2020, the \"Encyclopaedia of the Nazi Genocide of Sinti and Roma in Europe\", which is funded by the Federal Foreign Office, has been under development at the Research Centre on Antiziganism at Heidelberg University and has set itself the task of compiling, scientifically processing and making available the existing knowledge of the persecution and murder of Sinti and Roma in Europe (see https://encyclopaedia-gsr.eu/eng/).\r\n\r\nWith the help of IfZ, EHRI has been able to identify a number of other Holocaust-relevant online resources and archival guides on Germany.\r\n\r\nAn important online resource is the Zentrale Datenbank Nachlässe, provided by the Bundesarchiv, at http://www.nachlassdatenbank.de/\r\n\r\nThe following archival guides are also available:\r\n- [2023] *Archive in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz. Ein Adressenverzeichnis* (Münster: Ardey, 2023) [lists all archives],\r\n- [1996-2001] Jersch-Wenzel, Stefi & Andreas Reinke (eds), *Quellen zur Geschichte der Juden in den Archiven der neuen Bundesländer* (München: Saur, 1996-2001, multiple volumes, 1-6b),\r\n- [1995] Bauch, Herbert, *Quellen zu Widerstand und Verfolgung unter der NS-Diktatur in hessischen Archiven.

Kahlenberg, Julius H. Schoeps und Hanno Loewy Verlag für Berlin-Brandenburg, Potsdam 1996-1997.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the German archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nGermany exhibits a highly differentiated archival system without much centralization. In addition to the Federal Archives and their departments (governed by the Bundesarchivgesetz or Federal Archive Law), each Bundesland has its own State Archive, governed by the respective state archive law. There are over 1,300 municipal archives. The religious communities in Germany, first and foremost bodies and organizations of the Catholic and Protestant Churches as well as the Jewish community, exhibit a rich array of archival institutions. There are also university archives, archives of noble houses and a number of other, mostly topical archives as well as libraries holding archival material.\r\n\r\nKey institutions identified by EHRI include the Bundesarchiv [Federal Archive with all its departments] and the respective state archives [Landes-, Hauptstaats- and Staatsarchive] of the German Bundesländer as well as the Geheimes Staatsarchiv Berlin (for former Prussian institutions), which hold surviving files of central and regional administrative bodies, occupation authorities, the Nazi Party, personnel and membership files as well as post-war investigations; similar holdings can be found in the Nazi period archive assembled by the East German State Security Service [“Stasi”] now held by the BStU; the most pertinent municipal archives to Holocaust research include the city archives of Nuremberg and Frankfurt am Main; the archives of concentration camp memorial sites (pre-eminently Buchenwald, Dachau and Sachsenhausen), other memorials (Stiftung Denkmal, Haus der Wannsee-Konferenz) and research institutions (such as the Institute of Contemporary History Munich–Berlin); the Evangelical Central Archive and the Centrum Judaicum Archiv in Berlin; and the supranational Arolsen Archives (formerly known as the International Tracing Service) in Bad Arolsen.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Germany**\r\n\r\n**C. I. In Germany**\r\n\r\nIn Germany, EHRI has identified well over 300 repositories, including a number of memorial sites and documentation centres concerning the Holocaust or, more generally, the “Third Reich” dictatorship.\r\n\r\nThe EHRI portal includes collection descriptions provided by Bundesarchiv (BArch), the Arolsen Archives and the Institut für Zeitgeschichte (IfZ). Additionally, collection descriptions from state archives, memorial site archives, university archives and the Central Archives Heidelberg have been added to the portal.\r\n\r\nThe Bundesarchiv is the main institution holding the remaining records generated by the central administrative bodies of the German Reich under National Socialist rule. As a first step, EHRI and the Bundesarchiv decided to focus on the Reich (“R”) and NSDAP (“NS”) record groups. Since almost all state administrations and Nazi Party organizations were involved either directly or indirectly with measures against Jews, no further selection of records was undertaken apart from a chronological one (i.e. collections with an end date of before and including 1932 were excluded from the import to the EHRI Portal). The Bundesarchiv also has extensive holdings on post-war dealings with the Holocaust (e.g. compensation and judicial issues), as well as personal collections and film and photo materials. Following an internal survey by Bundesarchiv, the most relevant collections in the remaining record groups, especially “Bund” and “Nachlässe und Sammlungen” (mostly administered in Koblenz), were added to the portal. Descriptions from the Bundesarchiv for materials that are accessible at the Politisches Archiv des Auswärtigen Amtes have also been included in the EHRI portal. The Bundesarchiv Agency in Ludwigsburg holds the prosecution files of the Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes [“Zentrale Stelle der Landesjustizverwaltungen zur Aufklärung nationalsozialistischer Verbrechen”]. These cover almost all violent crimes committed during the Nazi regime and the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nThe Arolsen Archives are an international center for documenting National Socialist persecution and the liberated survivors. Former victims of Nazism and their families receive information regarding their incarceration, forced labor, and if available, post-war Allied assistance. The archives provide the foundation for research and education. The Arolsen collections include original records generated by the ITS, correspondence, and copies from other institutions and archives that helped the ITS fulfill its tasks. Having exclusively records that deal with National Socialist persecution and its aftermath, almost all its collections are relevant to EHRI. In a first step, Arolsen’s archivists and historians and EHRI have integrated the following sets of collections into the portal:\r\n- Incarceration and persecution\r\n- Registrations of Persons of non-German Nationality by German State Authorities\r\n- Registrations and Files of Displaced Persons, Children and Missing Persons\r\n- Special NSDAP Organizations and Activities\r\n- Death Marches/Identification of unknown dead\r\n\r\nFor IfZ, the existing archive thesaurus was used for content selection. The IfZ Archive staff agreed on a selection of keywords identified as Holocaust-related that were used to select records from the IfZ database (public entries: http://archiv.ifz-muenchen.de) to be included in a data export for the EHRI portal. Unfortunately, the export of the full hierarchical list of each individual term connected with an individual record is not technically possible at this point, so that only the lowest level of the exported term is visible in the EHRI Portal. For record groups that are currently not reflected or not well reflected in the public IfZ database, collection descriptions were manually entered after coordination with the IfZ Archive.\r\n\r\nIn an ongoing multi-step survey of state archives, EHRI has added collection descriptions from West German state archives selected according to a review of Boberach [1991] to the portal manually, with the aim of allowing for future sustainable connections and deepened coverage. For East German archives, an ongoing review of Jersch-Wenzel / Reinke / Reinke [1996-2001] may serve as a similar, even more detailed basis in the future.\r\nIn cooperation with the archives of the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site, the collection descriptions which have been written up internally so far were published on the EHRI portal in 2019.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nDue to frontier changes after the Second World War, a number of archives relevant to Holocaust research on Germany are today located in northern and western Poland, specifically in Gorzów Wielkopolski (formerly Landsberg an der Warthe), Koszalin/Köslin, Olsztyn/Allenstein, Opole/Oppeln, Szczecin/Stettin, Wrocław/Breslau and Zielona Góra/Grünberg.",

The National Archives is a government agency working within the domain of the Ministry of Education and Research acting on the basis of the Archives Act and Archival rules. The National Archives contain collections from Estonian public and private persons, primarily government institutions and organizations operated by government institutions; local governments; and government officials and other employees. There are also a number of archival institutions that work independently of the National Archives in Estonia like the Estonian Literary Museum. There are the archival collections at the National Library, the Library of the University of Tartu and at some museums. The registry of most of the archival collections in Estonia is the Estonian Archival Information System (see https://ais.ra.ee/en).",
                "summary": "EHRI has identified four institutions relevant to Holocaust research in Estonia, all based in the country’s capital, Tallinn. The Administration of National Archives is located in Tartu. A new main building was opened there in 2017 and many collections that were formerly held in Tallinn were transferred to repositories in Tartu. A full list is provided in the extensive report. At the National Archives of Estonia (formerly two archives, the Estonian State Archives in Tallinn and the Estonian Historical Archives in Tartu), where most collections pertaining to the Holocaust in Estonia are stored, EHRI has completed archival descriptions of over ten collections, including records on the German Security Police and SD in Estonia. Outside of Estonia, EHRI has identified several archival institutions which hold, to various degrees, collections relevant to Holocaust-research on Estonia. These include Yad Vashem, the National Archives of Latvia, State Historical Archives of Latvia, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies and Beit Terezin.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Estonia: Pre-existing research and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nEHRI identified the most important archival institutions holding Holocaust-relevant material in Estonia, relying on pre-existing academic research in the field, such as Ruth Bettina Birn: *Die Sicherheitspolizei in Estland 1941–1944. Eine Studie zur Kollaboration im Osten* (Paderborn, 2006); *Estonia 1940-1945. Reports of the Estonian International Commission for the Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity* (Tallinn, 2006); Anton Weiss-Wendt, *Murder Without Hatred: Estonians and the Holocaust* (Syracuse, 2009). EHRI also enlisted the assistance of a local specialist and, as a result, was able to identify important collections in four central archival institutions. In a second step, these collections were described, the descriptions then translated and added to the EHRI portal, where they are now accessible in English and Estonian.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Estonia’s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAn important number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created or are deposited in Estonia and can still be found in the country’s archives today. Access to them is mostly unrestricted, but records containing private or sensitive data may be withheld. For instance, personal data are protected for 30 years after a given person’s death, or, if the date of death is unknown, for 110 years after that person’s birth, or for 75 years after a given document’s creation if the dates of both birth and death are unknown. In a few cases the investigation files of the Soviet KGB or its predecessors NKGB, NKVD and others from the post-war period may be inaccessible due to both personal and sensitive data issues. That aside, researchers are allowed to take photographs from archival documents, or they can order, for a fee, digital or Xerox copies. On a practical level, a working knowledge of Estonian and/or Russian is helpful for any kind of archival research in Estonia. Most Holocaust-relevant documents, however, are in German. The local archival staff can provide help in English.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Estonia**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Estonia**\r\n\r\nHolocaust-relevant sources in Estonia are concentrated in the country’s capital, Tallinn, but divided among four archival institutions:\r\n- the National Archives of Estonia [Rahvusarhiiv]\r\n- the Estonian History Museum [Eesti Ajaloomuuseum]\r\n- the Estonian Jewish Museum [Eesti Juudi Museeum]\r\n- the Estonian Film Archives [Eesti Filmiarhiiv; now Department of the National Archives]\r\n\r\nAt the National Archives of Estonia, EHRI had identified and described a number of fonds containing a limited number of Holocaust-related records. The fonds Commander of the Security Police and SD, Estonian Security Police, Estonian SSR KGB may serve as examples of fonds that are highly important to Holocaust research on Estonia. Smaller numbers of relevant sources have been identified at the Estonian Film Archives and at the Estonian History Museum; the material stored in these institutions concerns mostly war crimes investigations. The holdings of the Estonian Jewish Museum mostly concern original materials and testimonies on Jewish life from the interwar period. Four regional departments of the National Archives, holding local documentation from the period after 1944, need to be investigated. They are, however, unlikely to hold significant quantities of Holocaust-related material.\r\n\r\nEHRI’s identification and description of these archival holdings has produced an easily accessible overview of Holocaust-relevant sources in Estonia that was previously unavailable in English.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Estonia, EHRI has identified more archival institutions holding, to various extents, collections relevant for Holocaust research. For instance, the National Archives of Latvia, State Historical Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacionālā arhīva, Latvijas Valsts vēstures arhīvs] hold the collections Wehrmacht Commander in Ostland and Commandant’s Office of the Security Police and the SD, both of which are relevant to Holocaust research on the Baltic States in general and to Estonia in particular. Furthermore, Yad Vashem, Beit Terezin and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum have collected and/or copied relevant material, e.g. on deportees to Estonia or from Estonian archives respectively.",

The seven Provincial Archives districts correspond with Finland’s current administrative structure. In addition to the archives managed by the Finnish state, there are private archives and museums which hold relevant collections.",
                "summary": "EHRI explored the Finnish archives for Holocaust-relevant material by building upon existing research and a growing scholarly interest in the history of Finland during the Holocaust, which used to be accessible only with adequate language skills. Archival guides on Holocaust-related material in Finland were available only in Finnish. Research institutions outside of Finland, such as the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, however, do provide a selection of copied Holocaust-relevant sources on Finland and may have reference works in languages other than Finnish.\r\n\r\nTwo major relevant archival institutions, as well as their key collections on the Holocaust, have been identified: the National Archives [Kansallisarkisto] with their seven provincial branches and the Archives of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs [Ulkoasiainministeriön arkisto]. Between them, the two institutions hold eight Holocaust-relevant fonds. For a more detailed description, see the extensive report. Within the National Archives, EHRI has translated the catalogue of the Finnish Jewish Archives into English, and entered it into the local database Vakka. For details, see the extensive report. Furthermore, EHRI has assembled information on sources regarding the country’s involvement in the Holocaust that has been made available by collecting institutions outside of Finland, such as the USHMM, NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies and Yad Vashem.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Finland: Pre-existing research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nIn Finland, EHRI’s exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources was able to rely on some important pre-existing research in the field, such as Hannu Rautkallio’s *Finland and the Holocaust* (1987) or Oula Silvennnoinen’s *Geheime Waffenbrüderschaft. Die sicherheitspolizeiliche Zusammenarbeit zwischen Deutschland und Finnland* (2010), which had already made extensive use of archival sources kept both in Finland and a number of other countries. Furthermore, during EHRI’s first phase, its Finnish consortium partner, the National Archives of Finland, translated and coordinated the survey and data descriptions of Holocaust-related sources for the project. As a result, important collections in two Helsinki-based central archives were identified, and some additional material in Finnish provincial archives was discovered. These collections were described, the descriptions then translated and added to the EHRI portal, where they are now accessible in Finnish and English.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Finland’s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nA considerable number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created in Finland and can still be found in the country’s archives today. File dispersal is minimal, thanks to negligible wartime destruction of archival material and to the concentration of the country’s archival institutions in Helsinki. Access to archival sources is unrestricted, with the exception of personal data which, according to § 28 of the Population Information Act 661/2009, can only be accessed 50 years after a person’s death or, if the year of death is unknown, 100 years after that person’s birth. A working knowledge of Finnish is necessary for any kind of archival research in Finland, even though documents in other languages (sometimes English, French, German, but mostly Russian and Swedish) can also be found with the help of the local archival staff.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Finland**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Finland**\r\n\r\nIn Finland, EHRI has identified two archival institutions which hold Holocaust-relevant collections. Both are located in Helsinki:\r\n- the National Archives [Kansallisarkisto], and\r\n- the Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [Ulkoasiainministeriön arkisto]\r\n\r\nAt these two archives alone, eight Holocaust-related fonds have been identified and described in both Finnish and English. The large Finnish Jewish Archives (an important part of which consists of the Helsinki Jewish community archives) is held by the National Archives. The catalogue of the Finnish Jewish Archives was translated into English for EHRI, and entered both into the local database Vakka and into the EHRI portal. It was possible to integrate the data of this large fonds using OAI-PMH or “harvesting” (i.e. Open Archives Initiative – Protocol for Metadata Harvesting), so all levels of the description (including child items) are included.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions for the other seven fonds were done manually. As such, the National Archives also have descriptions for the large Archive of the Finnish Red Cross, and personal files compiled by the Finnish State Police (VALPO) on Finns and foreigners who were considered politically suspicious. The Holocaust-relevant sources preserved at the Archives of the Foreign Ministry, on the other hand, fit in a small number of boxes and single files, but are important nonetheless. They contain information on the “Jewish question” and Jewish refugees, but also on the war crimes investigation against the head of the Finnish State Police, Arno Anthoni. EHRI has yet to include the archives of the Finnish Ministry of Defence, which have partly been surveyed by the USHMM. Outside the Helsinki-based central archives, the Turku branch of the provincial archives holds the Archives of the Jewish Community of Turku. Six more Finnish provincial archives remain to be surveyed for Holocaust-relevant material.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nEHRI’s identification and description work on Finland was important as there are no third parties known to have carried out systematic surveys so far. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has microfilmed a limited number of sources from the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and from the Finnish Ministry of Defence records. European archival institutions, such as NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam, hold further Holocaust-relevant material on Finland as does the German Bundesarchiv.",

The archive and documentation centre of the Mémorial, the former Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine [CDJC, Centre of Contemporary Jewish Documentation[, holds more than 30 million archival documents, including many originals bearing the signatures of the heads of the Third Reich and those responsible for the deportation of the Jews from France. Since 24 December 2015, the French government opened access to the judicial archives concerning the Vichy regime, collaborationists and the purge during the liberation of France.

It is also worth mentioning the National Archives branch for France’s overseas colonies [Archives Nationales d'Outre-mer], where the unique “Préfecture de Constantine. Service des questions juives et des sociétés secrètes” collection can be found. Finally, the National Audiovisual Institute [INA, Institut National de l’Audiovisuel] holds Holocaust-related audiovisual material.\r\n\r\nOther important Holocaust-relevant archival institutions in France include the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, the Fondation pour la Mémoire de la Déportation, the ORT-archives, the “Contemporaine” Library (former Bibliothèque de Documentation Internationale Contemporaine which holds the archives of the Cimade), the Fédération Nationale des Déportés et Internés Résistants et Patriotes, Maison de la culture yiddish – Bibliothèque Medem, and the Alliance Israélite Universelle.",

The project currently presents two maps: the ‘Cartographie des enfants juifs de Paris déportés de juillet 1942 à août 1944’ [Map of Jewish children deported from Paris between July 1942 and August 1944] and the same map covering the whole of France.\r\n\r\n**B.

In France**\r\n\r\nEHRI has merged and updated the existing information about archives holding Holocaust-relevant materials in France. The portal currently contains over 120 repository descriptions, including the National Archives, the Departmental Archives), the archives of the Ministries of Defence, Justice, Foreign Affairs, and several Jewish archives and institutions.\r\n\r\nOne of the , if not the, most important archive on the subject in France, is the Mémorial de la Shoah in Paris. The archive and documentation centre of the Mémorial, the former Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine [CDJC, Centre of Contemporary Jewish Documentation], hold more than 30 million archival documents, including many originals bearing the signature of the heads of the Third Reich and of those responsible for the deportation of the Jews from France. These historical documents are contained in the archive collections listed below, which can be consulted in the reading room of the Documentation Centre. An archival catalogue is available online (not including data relating to the privacy of individuals mentioned). The Mémorial’s collections include German, French and other source collections.\r\n\r\nThe German sources include records from the Headquarters of the Militärbefehlshaber in Frankreich (MBF). The MBF, or German military administration in France, is divided into two major sections:\r\n1. Archives of the military command, which cover the collaboration between the occupation authorities and the Pétain government in general, the persecution of the Jews and the general reprisal policy;\r\n2. Archives of the administrative command, which include the documents dealing with the control of the occupation authorities over the French economy (interference, spoliations, in particular economic aryanisation). More specifically:\r\n  - The German Embassy in Paris, which was very actively involved in the anti-Jewish measures as can be attested by the numerous telegrams and letters sent several times per day to Berlin by Abetz and Schleier (Plenipotentiary Minister at the German embassy in Paris),\r\n  - The Gestapo in occupied France: the most important group of archives analysed is made up of the records of the Anti-Jewish division of the Gestapo in Paris. This group includes letters, telegrams, and reports on internments, deportations and other measures taken against the Jews, such as wearing the yellow star, rescinding naturalisations as well as general reprisals. There are also documents showing the pressure exerted on Italian policy in their occupied zone. This group also contains documents on the Gestapo in France preserved in the German federal archives [Bundesarchiv Koblenz]. These records give us a true picture of the structures and the activity of the Gestapo in France and in particular in the anti-Jewish division, first led by Dannecker then Rothke.\r\n\r\nThe “Archives of the Nuremberg Trials” contain part of the documentation collected for the investigations of the international military trial as well as the trials conducted by the American military court. For this major group of archives, a specific classification system is used. The main subdivisions are as follows:\r\n- NO (Nazi Organisation): this reference includes the documents from any Nazi organisation, in particular on the role of the S.S., and the WVHA (Central Office of the Economy and the Administration of the S.S.)\r\n- NOKW (Nazi \"Oberkommando der Wehrmacht\"): documents concerning the activities of the German army\r\n- NG (Nazi Government): documents illustrating the activity of the State bodies related to those of the Party\r\n- NI (Nazi Industry): documents related to industry and the financial institutions of the Third Reich\r\n\r\nThe French source collections at the Mémorial include:\r\n- The archives of the General Commissariat for Jewish Questions, or Archives du Commissariat Général aux Questions Juives (CGQJ), with more than 20,000 documents, including the trial proceedings against its leaders\r\n- The archives of Professor Montandon, an ethnologist and \"expert on racial issues\" with the CGQJ. This piecemeal collection covers the period 1924 to 1944 and primarily concerns his ethnological scientific work and his anti-Jewish propaganda activities from 1938 onwards\r\n- The archives of the Institut d'Étude des Questions Juives, a body created in 1941 under the instigation of Dannecker and of which the Mémorial holds the major portion of the surviving documents. The collection includes the correspondence of the Secretary General and describes all the activities of the Institute\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the archives of the Mémorial contain many other documents, including the Service of the Armistice, the Prefecture of the Police as well as Jewish organisations such as: l'Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants (O.S.E.); les Eclaireurs Israélites de France (E.I.F.); la Fédération des Sociétés Juives de France (F.S.J.F.); Le Conseil Représentatif des Institutions Juives de France (C.R.I.F.); l'Oeuvre de Protection de L'Enfance Juive (O.P.E.J.); and la Commission Centrale de l'Enfance (C.C.E.). Furthermore, many private collections have been donated to the Mémorial.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the EHRI project, Mémorial de la Shoah was changing its database system. Therefore data integration was not possible in the early stage of the project. Moreover, the descriptive system of the Mémorial was two-fold: a very general description of its holdings on its website and an item description for internal use. Neither of these met EHRI's specifications of top-level collection descriptions. Therefore, Mémorial de la Shoah started by describing the heart of its collections in French and English. All the available metadata have now been integrated into the EHRI portal.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Mémorial de la Shoah’s collections, EHRI provides descriptions for material at several other archival institutions in France. Namely, the National Archives, which hold administrative records created by several ministries and other central public bodies during the Vichy regime; Vichy and post-war legal proceedings; and documents donated by survivors. The material related to the General Commission on Jewish Affairs [Commissariat général aux questions juives] is particularly significant. EHRI has also described the closely-related ‘Archives of the Institute for the Study of Jewish Questions’ [Archives de l’Institut d’étude des question juives], which are held by the Defence Historical Service [Service historique de la Défense]. Moreover, EHRI provides descriptions for material at the National Archives branch for France’s overseas colonies and the National Audiovisual Institute, which possesses Holocaust-related audiovisual material. Finally, EHRI also provides links from departmental archival institutions to several United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) archival descriptions, which are available as copies at the USHMM.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nThe USHMM holds many copies of many different French archival institutions; Furthermore, the NARA (National Archives and Records Administration) in Maryland/USA possesses all the archives of the U.S. embassy in France from 1936–1941 and 1944–1953 under “Records of the Foreign Service Posts of the Department of State.” In Germany, Bundesarchiv holds a number of relevant collections, as does the Politisches Archiv des Auswärtigen Amts and the Institut für Zeitgeschichte. In Israel and Russia, Yad Vashem and the RGVA hold records and copies from various organisations and offices in France.",

Characteristics of the British archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe National Archives in London are the official archives for the UK Government, storing its records and those of the United Kingdom’s central courts. The Public Records Act (1958) places responsibility for the management of public records on departments. Additional repositories of The National Archives also exist on the Channel Islands, Jersey and Guernsey. In addition to The National archives, there are many private archive initiatives.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on the United Kingdom**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In the United Kingdom**\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom, EHRI has identified over 20 repositories, and is able to provide over hundreds of archival descriptions from several institutions. The Wiener Holocaust Library is the oldest Holocaust memorial institution in the world. Founded as the Jewish Central Information Office in 1933 by Dr Alfred Wiener, the Library has been based in London since 1939 and holds extensive collections including published and unpublished works, eyewitness accounts, photographs and press cuttings.\r\n\r\nHolocaust-related material, however, is held by many other archival institutions, such as the Island Archives in Guernsey, which hold extensive collections on the German occupation of Guernsey (1940-1945), including those of the Feldkommandantur and the local civil administration, or Jersey Archives, which stores registration cards and significant records of all aspects from the German occupation. In The National Archives, there are very important documents relating to the Second World War and the Holocaust among the British government and military records. The most popular are within departments War Office (WO), Home Office (HO), Prime Minister’s Office Records (PREM) and Foreign Office (FO). The National Archives also holds records of war crimes and criminals (both alleged and proved) from 1939–1945 as well as copies of documents captured by the Western Allied forces from enemy powers at the end of the Second World War. Furthermore, the Imperial War Museum in London has collections ranging from film and oral history to works of art and large objects, but also to personal letters and diaries. The Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum as well as the Polish Underground Movement Study Trust hold important Holocaust-related material generated by the Polish government-in-exile as well as the Polish underground in occupied Poland. The collections in the Sikorski Institute are now regarded as holding the most important Polish émigré collections in the world. An extensive description of the Institute and its holdings can be found in Alina Skibińska’s archival guide, which has been revised and translated into English as part of EHRI’s efforts to make Holocaust-relevant sources linked to Poland easier to locate.\r\n\r\nFinally, archives in the UK also house many sources about the Holocaust in other countries, mainly concerning British intelligence on what was happening in occupied Europe as well as the reactions of the governments-in-exile and resistance movements located in the UK.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of the United Kingdom, the United State Memorial Museum, Yad Vashem hold collections that are relevant to Holocaust research on the United Kingdom.",

This series is co-published by EHRI-partner Institute for Contemporary History Munich-Berlin [Institut für Zeitgeschichte München-Berlin, IfZ]. A translation of the series into English under the title *The Persecution and Murder of European Jews by Nazi Germany, 1933–1945* is under preparation with the cooperation of Yad Vashem.\r\n\r\nThe GSA has an online catalogue, Arxeiomnimon (2013): http://arxeiomnimon.gak.gr/. Containing some seven million pages of documents it allows navigation through parts of the archival collections originating from 37 GSA agencies (the central service and 36 branches). It should be noted that while the metadata fields are provided in English, the actual descriptions are in Greek. Furthermore, those agencies and materials not included in Arxeiomnimon as of yet are either uncatalogued, or published in Greek-language finding aids or index cards stored in the reading rooms of the respective branches. These published finding aids and index cards, however, are less standardized than the online database.\r\n\r\nThe Hellenic Literary and Historical Archive, better known as E.L.I.A. (part of the National Bank of Greece Cultural Foundation, M.I.E.T.) also has an extensive online Greek language catalogue which meets international metadata standards: http://www.elia.org.gr/ \r\n\r\nAnother useful online resource is the [Database of Greek-Jewish Holocaust Survivors’ Testimonies](http://gjst.ha.uth.gr/en/theproject.php), which has built up a vast collection of audio and visual testimonies from Greek Jews who survived the Holocaust. The database is a virtual archive that systematically brings together testimonies from repositories in Greece and abroad, public and private collections, collected in different languages and places, at different times. \r\nEHRI started its identification and investigation work for data integration on Greece from researcher interviews carried out by the “user requirements” for the project. By linking data integration and user requirements, EHRI aims to ensure that the EHRI Portal will attract historians, archivists, and the general public, and that it identifies the data that researchers hope to find on the EHRI Portal, in order to generate more interest and offer more meaningful content and format. Researchers of the Holocaust in Greece interviewed by EHRI were asked to suggest further researchers specialized in Holocaust history in Greece to participate in an EHRI workshop on data integration and Holocaust research in Greece, which took place in December 2012. Four representatives of archival institutions in Greece, three graduate students, two junior and two senior researchers participated in the workshop.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the workshop was to receive expert feedback on this list and further complete EHRI’s overview of the archival institutions and identify Holocaust-related collections within the institutions. EHRI also needed to better understand the format of the metadata and detect where further surveying was necessary. The overall goal was to create a state-of-the-art report of identified Holocaust-related sources in Greece and to add this information to the EHRI portal, as much as possible via the technical Work Packages (as opposed to manually entering the information into the portal).\r\n\r\nThe Greek workshop has had multiple benefits for EHRI as it has helped ensure that the content fits the user. It was a time-efficient identification method which avoided duplication of work. At the same time, it was an investment in smooth communication with future Portal users. We found that the EHRI Portal can support Holocaust-research in Greece by improving access to information about the materials, be it awareness about and location of repositories or identifying relevant collections within repositories. Engaging with the research community can help EHRI further enrich the data by annotating and adding it to the portal. A second important role for EHRI can be to reach out to the institutions and offer them tools and a platform to share the information about their holdings to the research community.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Greek archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nA major challenge in Greece is that there are an unknown number of materials which remain largely invisible. As a consequence, there is no indication about their existence online and there is a huge (digital) description backlog, which requires thorough identifying and inventorying. As a consequence, uncatalogued materials remain hidden.\r\n\r\nFinding aids are often only consultable at the repository itself. The limited amount of online information and locally available cataloguing systems make access to the physical materials time consuming, often costly, and inefficient (a research trip is hard to prepare).\r\n\r\nAnother challenge concerns receiving permission for consultation. Access to public archives in Greece often requires an application procedure before any access is granted. Two laws regulate the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal and sensitive archives (1991 and 1997). The time limit for keeping records restricted was reduced from fifty to thirty years (although there is room for flexibility in certain cases). In some cases it is not possible or there are limits to taking photographs as well as making scans or photocopies. Sometimes, a reading room’s lack of capacity can be an issue.\r\n\r\nAt the Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, not all archives can be made publicly accessible for reasons of national security, among others. Moreover, there has been at least one case where a collection of documents concerning the Holocaust was removed from the original collections and was put in one separate collection, leading to a loss of context.\r\n\r\nAnother issue pertains to the destruction of archives. The destruction of archives does not only apply to Holocaust archives, but has included sources Holocaust-related sources. For example, the archives of the Greek Agency for War Crimes, which was founded in the autumn of 1945, were totally destroyed in 1975. In some cases, materials have been scanned before destruction. The Jewish Community of Thessaloniki, which engages in such digitization projects, has preserved certain sources in this way. \r\n\r\nYet another challenge is that material is in the possession of private organisations which do not necessarily consider themselves archival institutions. These archives are hard to locate and often remain “hidden treasures”. Being able to share the knowledge on the mere existence of these hidden treasures by entering or annotating them to the EHRI portal could already be a major step forward for Greek Holocaust research, especially at the local level, in Jewish community archives.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Greece**\r\n\r\nIn Greece, EHRI identified 43 Holocaust-relevant repositories, and was able to present 96 archival descriptions by December 2018. While many archival institutions can be found, predictably, in the country’s capital, Athens, important collections are also held by regional branches of the General State Archives (GSA), especially in Greece’s northern regions, i.e. in Central Macedonia, as well as in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace.\r\n\r\nThe largest institution for EHRI’s purposes in Greece, the General State Archives (National Archives of Greece, GSA), are the national institution responsible for the preservation and promotion of the Greek archival materials. The institution was created in 1914 and its operation is organized by law. The Greek State Archives consist of a central service, 47 regional services and 16 local archives. Based on the location of the wartime Jewish communities in Greece – in at least 27 cities according to the Central Board of Jewish Communities of Greece (2009) – researchers will have to visit different GSA branches if they wish to consult archives relating to particular communities. It is also important to keep in mind that a large amount of the material in the GSA remains non-digital and not all the digitized materials have been included in Arxeiomnimon yet.\r\n\r\nIn March 2008, all branches of the GSA were asked to provide an overview of collections and documents related to the history of the Jews in Greece and the Holocaust in order to prepare the survey work of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM). The responses were rather limited: fifteen to twenty local offices submitted such a report, which varied from a short note confirming there is such material available to an overview of records. These overviews have served as orientation tools for EHRI’s work in Greece. \r\n\r\nBeyond the GSA’s collections, the Jewish Museum of Greece (JMG) conserves more than 2,000 artefacts, including books and pamphlets, periodicals, maps, documents, manuscripts (personal notes, correspondence, memoires, diaries, etc.), false IDs, personal objects, ritual objects, jewellery, textiles and costumes, clothing, badges, armbands, numismatics (coins, banknotes, stock certificates) and an art collection. The JMG’s Holocaust archive includes records of the Central Agency for the Custody of Jewish Property (the Ypiresias Diacheirisis Israilitikon Periousion, Y.D.I.P. archive), the Ο.Π.Α.Ι.Ε archive (O.P.A.I.E., the Heirless Property and Jewish Rehabilitation Fund), private and personal archives which include material pertinent to the Shoah, the JMG Archive of Oral Testimonies and a Photographic Archive. The JMG’s Holocaust Photographic Archive has a rich and expanding collection of photographic images spanning from the pre-war period to the early 1950s. The broad subject areas, each including several subcategories, capture Jewish life before, during and after the Second World War and the Holocaust. An extensive number of document scans and photographs of the museum’s collection have been uploaded in Judaica Europeana.\r\n\r\nWhile EHRI has identified a considerable number of archives and institutions with Holocaust-relevant collections, many others are yet to be located. For example, the location of the Police and Army Archives remains unknown. The same goes for sources relating to two concentration camps in Greece where Jews were imprisoned. Archival documentation on their presence is missing. In other cases, EHRI is aware of the existence of archives that are likely to hold Holocaust-related materials, but is yet to ascertain the significance of their collections. Archives and institutions that fall under this category include: the Chamber of Commerce, the Court House and other juridical archives; municipal archives; church archives (for example: the archives of the Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church); Communist Party Archives; Red Cross Archives; public and private company archives (electricity, water, port companies); and private collections kept in museums, at home, or in private institutions. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the identification of the relevant repositories, EHRI has also found that certain archives, which were originally thought to hold Holocaust-related materials, do not in fact have such material. For example, it was found that not all municipal archives of cities with a Jewish community during the Second World War, had kept their collections, but had transferred them to local GSA branches.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Greece, archives and collections relevant to the period of the Holocaust in Greece can be found in a number of countries, some of which are partially covered by Holocaust-relevant archival guides. For Germany, for instance, there is Irith Dublon-Knebel’s overview *German Foreign Office Documents on the Holocaust in Greece* (2007), while for Italy, there are collections of documents edited by Daniel Carpi, *Italian Diplomatic Documents on the History of the Holocaust in Greece* (1941-1943), Tel Aviv, Diaspora Research Center-Tel Aviv University, 1999.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, relevant archival holdings are located at the Political Archive of the German Foreign Office in Berlin, the Federal Archives-Department Military Archives in Freiburg, the Federal Archives-The Central Office for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes in Lundwigsburg, and the Arolsen Archives. Finally, in Bulgaria archival holdings can be found at the Central State Archives in Sofia and the Central Military Archives in Veliko Turnovo.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, relevant archival holdings are located at the National Archives in Washington DC, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC, the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York, the Visual History Archive/USC Shoah Foundation in Los Angeles, the American Joint Distribution Committee Archives in New York, and the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Sterling Memorial Library (Yale University). A special note needs to be made about copies of the archives of the following Greek Jewish communities which were copied and made available for research at USHMM, but remain largely inaccessible for research in Greece itself for various reasons (including lack of resources). USHMM has completed its digitization in Larissa and Chalkida; digitization has been started in Volos, Ioannina, and Trikala; digitization may continue in Athens, Corfu and Rhodes.\r\n\r\nIn Israel, relevant archival holdings are located at the Yad Vashem Archives in Jerusalem, the Central Zionist Archives in Jerusalem, the Hagana History Archives in Tel Aviv, the Ghetto Fighters’ House Archives in Galilee, and the Institute of Contemporary Jewry, Oral History Division (Hebrew University).\r\n\r\nIn England, relevant archival holdings are located at the National Archives in Kew; in Spain, at the Archives of the Spanish Foreign Office in Madrid; in Switzerland, at the International Committee of the Red Cross Archives in Geneva; and in Austria, at the Central Europe Center for Research and Documentation (known as Centropa) in Vienna.",

Together with the addition of newly identified institutions, there are now some 30 CHIs in Croatia on the EHRI Portal. Next, EHRI identified the collections via a top-down approach starting with the institutions with the largest number of relevant collections (Croatian State Archive, The State Archive of the City of Zagreb; as well as those of cities like Slavonski Brod, Osijek, etc.). ",
                "extensive": "Disclaimer: The EHRI Extensive Report was updated in 2024.\r\n\r\n**A. EHRI approach to Croatia: Pre-existing research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nIn order to investigate and identify Holocaust-related sources in Croatian archives, EHRI enlisted a local expert and reviewed the pertinent research. EHRI was able to draw on pre-existing research, such as: Narcisa Lengel Krizman ed. *Zna li se: Antisemitizam – Holokaust – Antifašizam* (1996) also in English as *Anti-semitism, Holocaust, Anti-Fascism* (1997); Ivo and Slavko Goldstein’s *Holokaust u Zagrebu* (2001); Zlata Živaković-Kerže, *Stradanja i pamćenja: Holokaust u Osijeku i život koji se nastavlja* (2006); Đuro Zatezalo, Jadovno. Kompleks ustaških logora 1941, I–II (2007); Vladimir Geiger / Martina Grahek Ravančić / Marica Karakaš Obradov (eds.) *Logori, zatvori i prisilni rad u Hrvatskoj/Jugoslaviji 1941–1945, 1945–1951* (2010); Alexander Korb’s *Im Schatten des Weltkriegs: Massengewalt der Ustasa gegen Serben, Juden und Roma in Kroatien 1941–1945* (2013); Marica Karakaš Obradov, “Prisilne migracije židovskog stanovništva na području Nezavisne Države Hrvatske”, *Croatica Christiana periodica* 37:72 (2013); Marica Karakaš Obradov, “Iseljavanje Židova iz Hrvatske nakon Drugoga svjetskog rata”, Historijski zbornik 66:2 (2013); Ivo Goldstein, Jasenovac (2018); Zdravko Dizdar, *Logor Danica u Koprivnici* 1941–1942, 1–3, (2017 – 2020); Naida-Michal Brandl, *Židovi u hrvatskoj nakon Holokausta* (2023). \r\n\r\nAs a result, a number of useful finding aids were identified. Online search tools are provided by both the Croatian State Archives and the National and University Library:\r\n- Hrvatski arhivski informacijski sustav / Croatian archival information system (https://hais.arhiv.hr/HDA/) \r\n- Biblionet (http://biblionet.arhiv.hr/)\r\n- The National and University Library (https://www.nsk.hr)\r\n\r\nA more traditional guide with general information about archives in Croatia is Igor Karaman’s *Studije i prilozi iz arhivistike* (Zagreb: Arhiv Hrvatske, 1993).\r\n\r\nFor a general guide on archival holdings in the Republic of Croatia see Vida Pavliček, “Pregled arhivskih fondova i zbirki Republike Hrvatske. Rad na prikupljanju i obradi podataka”, Arhivski vjesnik 50:1 (2007): 9–32. Regarding the archival material on the Holocaust, Josip Kolanović published a paper “Holocaust in Croatia – Documentation and research perspectives” Arhivski vjesnik 39 (1996): 157–174 and in 2013, the Croatian State Archives published an online paper presenting Holocaust-relevant collections (http://zagreb.arhiv.hr/hr/teme/holokaust.htm). It should also be noted that most collections in the Croatian State Archive and other state archives throughout the country have their own finding aids with descriptions of what can be found in which box of an entire collection. Some collections are better explored than others, often depending on the interests of archivists who use the collections for PhD theses or other post-doc works. However, they are available only in the archives themselves, and not online. General Guide for Archival Holdings in Republic of Croatia (Pregled arhivskih fondova i zbirki Republike Hrvatske, Zagreb: Hrvatski državni arhiv, 2006–2007) is contemporary Croatian archives service obligatory finding aid, which provides basic data on archival holdings in Republic of Croatia in custody of archival, but also of non-archival institutions. It does not, however, single out “Holocaust” as a keyword. Its latest edition (2006) is not available in pdf.\r\n\r\nAs for surveys by third parties the USHMM has been intermittently active in Croatia since the late 1990s (Sporazum o suradnji između “United States Holocaust Memorial Museum-a” i Hrvatskog državnog arhiva. Bulletin. Hrvatski državni arhiv (Zagreb). 6:1–2 (1995): 17–18). During the 1990s, local experts surveyed and copied war-time material at the Zagreb State Archives. It leads an endeavor to digitalise material from other state archives in the country and pre-war records from Zagreb. The USHMM is also helping the Jewish Community in Zagreb archive to sort its material, which will later be digitalised. The microfilmed collections from the Second World War (surveyed in the 1990s), plus scanned material from the interwar period and the Second World War (ongoing survey) from different repositories around the country is gradually being put online. The work on the identification of the post-war material is in progress.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Croatian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAll collections are usually accessible to the public, but if a file refers to a person who was born less than 100 years ago, it will not be possible to copy that file. Each archival director is responsible for the approval of requests to scan or copy specific material submitted by individual research projects rather than through a more global agreement between institutions.\r\n\r\nAlthough important online search tools are available, they are of limited use for Holocaust scholars. Furthermore, keywords such as “Jewish” or “Holocaust” will not produce many results in these online search databases. Some collection descriptions on HAIS mention that “part of the material was copied for the needs of USHMM” (but typing “USHMM” into the search box will not lead one to collections copied for the USHMM).\r\n\r\nKnowledge of regional history, on how institutions were organized, and of who (or which political body) was in charge at given dates in time is essential to find relevant information within the body of archival material. In some cases, there is a high probability of identifying Holocaust-relevant files, but often it is more like “finding a needle in a haystack”. Researchers need to rely on assistance from local archivists to identify or at least narrow down the search for relevant information to a number of collections. However, this can still leave one with hundreds of boxes to consult without any firm indication of what they may contain.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Croatia**\r\n\r\n**C. I. In Croatia**\r\n\r\nEHRI identified and investigated Holocaust-relevant archival institutions and collections in Croatia in close cooperation with USHMM and Yad Vashem. The Croatian State Archive in Zagreb and the State Archive of the City of Zagreb are of particular importance. Two other state archives, in Osijek (a city with the second largest Jewish community in Croatia) and Rijeka (Fiume in Italian), a city in the northern Adriatic are equally important. These two archives are regional centres; Osijek has a rich Jewish history and was home to the second largest Jewish community in Croatia and during the Second World War the border town of Rijeka received thousands of Jewish refugees who had escaped To Italian held areas in NDH, or to the Italian territory. Three other cities with state archives and a relatively rich Jewish history are Varaždin, in the north, Slavonski Brod, which also has a relatively strong and as yet under-researched Jewish heritage, and Split, on the southern coast. Until the 19th century, Split’s Jewish community mostly consisted of Sephardic Jews, but this community also had roots dating back to the Roman period.\r\n\r\nApart from the State Archives, other important collection-holding institutions are the National and University Library in Zagreb (which stores interwar Jewish periodicals, some of which were published until April/May 1941), and the library and archive of the Jewish community center in Zagreb. At the time of writing, the latter is not yet open to the public as it is awaiting archival renovation and the sorting of its archival material into collections. There are smaller Jewish community archives in other Croatian cities and towns, which do not function as public institutions. One needs to first contact somebody from the local Jewish community to find out where they are and if their holdings can be consulted. However, the majority of archival collections of different Jewish communities in Croatia are held in the Jewish Historical Museum in Belgrade, Serbia.\r\n\r\nOther relevant institutions for Holocaust research in Croatia include the Documentation Center for Holocaust Victims and Survivors (CENDO), the Jasenovac Memorial and the Croatian History Museum of Croatia in Zagreb. The latter reported that they have some possibly interesting material concerning Croatian Jewish families within the Documentation and Information Department, and in the Photography department. However, the museum is under-staffed, so the archives have not been completely sorted and are not recognized as “Holocaust material” even though many of the families whose lives are documented perished during the war. The museum would like to see these materials labelled as Holocaust-related in the future. A similar situation applies to the Brod Regional Museum [Muzej Brodskog Posavlja] in Slavonski Brod.\r\n\r\nThe Archdiocesan Archives are now a part of the Croatian State Archive system, but some collections are held in a separate location within the church. Therefore, it has been added as a separate institution.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the USHMM and Yad Vashem, EHRI has yet to determine which archival institutions and collections outside of Croatia are relevant to Holocaust research on Croatia. Due to the fact that the territory of the NDH incorporated territory of the Eastern Srijem that s today’s Serbia as well as the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, some archives and museums in NW Serbia as well as those in Bosnia and Herzegovina, for example Banja Luka, Tuzla, Sarajevo, etc. have some documents relevant to Croatia. The Military Archives in Belgrade probably has archival collections relevant to the Holocaust in Croatia due to the fact that it still holds archival collections of the NDH and the Archives of Yugoslavia in Belgrade, is likely to hold relevant collections.",

The Public Records Act was modified by Act LXI of 2012, which fundamentally changed Hungary’s archival system. On 1 October 2012, the Hungarian National Archives [Magyar Országos Levéltár], the central repository holding collections transferred from national government bodies, as well as all county and most of the city archives were integrated into the newly established National Archives of Hungary [Magyar Nemzeti Levéltár], a centralized, state-controlled body.

EHRI has identified a significant number of Holocaust-relevant repositories in Hungary, a full list of which can be found in the extensive report. ",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Hungary: Pre-existing research and third-party surveys**\r\n\r\nThe first large-scale survey of Holocaust-related archival records in Hungary was launched in the late 1950s and early 1960s and was conducted by Elek Karsai and his associates on behalf of the National Agency of Hungarian Israelites (MIOK). It resulted in the publication of a three volume series – Benoschofsky Ilona, Karsai Elek (eds.), *Vádirat a nácizmus ellen. Dokumentumok a magyarországi zsidóüldözés történetéhez* 3 vols., Budapest: Magyar Izraeliták Országos Képviselete, Kiadói félvászonkötésben 1958-1967 – and a broad selection of documents known as “Series I” were made available on 180 microfilms in the Hungarian National Archives, Yad Vashem and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. In 1994, a follow-up project was launched by Ágnes Ságvári, which resulted in the creation of minor collections of selected Holocaust records in all the municipal (county) archives in Hungary, as well as a series of source publications. In 1993, a research guide to archival materials relevant for Jewish studies in Hungary (including some Holocaust-related parts as well) was published: György Haraszti and Géza Komoróczy (eds), *Magyar zsidó levéltári repertórium* [*Hungarian Jewish Archival Guide*] Vols. 1-2. Budapest: MTA Judaisztikai Kutatócsoport, 1993. Due to the re-organisation of the material, merging archives, newly found or added records and several other reasons, the information provided by this guide has remained incomplete, requiring updates and corrections.\r\n\r\nThe finding aids and descriptions available at archives in Hungary tend to provide scholars specialised in Holocaust Studies with little specific information. With the sole exception of the Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives, none of the archives in Hungary provide visitors with detailed finding aids in English. Only some offer online collection descriptions, but in most cases only a general overview of the holdings is available online. However, many institutions have launched digitisation projects and there is an increasing number of online finding aids.\r\n\r\nThe research teams of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Yad Vashem Archives have conducted extensive research in the previous two decades in Hungary. They prepared detailed collection-level and file-level descriptions for institutions of particular importance to Holocaust research, including the Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives, the National Archives of Hungary, the Budapest Municipal Archives, the Historical Archives of the State Security and the Institute and Museum of Military History.\r\n\r\nThe most recent major comprehensive documentary account on the topic in English is *The Holocaust in Hungary. Evolution of a Genocide* by Zoltán Vági, László Csősz and Gábor Kádár (Washington, DC: AltaMira Press-USHMM, 2013). The volume offers a selection of archival material from various archives in Hungary and abroad. The most relevant archival sources, especially on the history of the ghettoisation and deportation in 1944 are summarised in the entries of Randolph L. Braham (ed.), *Geographical Encyclopedia of the Holocaust in Hungary* (Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern University Press, 2013). \r\n\r\nEHRI’s experts on Hungary have made good use of the online finding aids on the microfilmed Hungarian records available on the USHMM website as well as of the valuable survey material we have obtained from colleagues at the Yad Vashem Archives. In addition, they have consulted archivists of the key collection-holding institutes.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Hungarian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAccording to the Act on public records, public archives and the protection of private archival holdings (in short: Archives Act, Act LXVI of 1995), public archives in Hungary were divided into national (general) archives, specialised state archives, municipal (city and county) archives, archives of public foundations and other public bodies, as well as private archives open to the public. The Public Records Act was modified by Act LXI of 2012, which brought about fundamental changes in the archival system. The Hungarian National Archives [Magyar Országos Levéltár], the central repository holding collections transferred from national government bodies as well as all county and most of the city archives, were integrated on 1 October 2012 into the newly established National Archives of Hungary [Magyar Nemzeti Levéltár], a centralised, state-controlled body. A few municipal archives have not been merged into these new central archives, including the Budapest Municipal Archives. In addition, there are several specialised archives, some 20 church and 20 Jewish community archives as well as other collection-holding institutions, including about 25 museums, major Budapest libraries, and private collections that hold records relevant for Holocaust research.\r\n\r\nIn Hungary, any person may, upon preliminary application, be granted free access to archival records held in public archives. Access to public records preserved in the National Archives of Hungary and its branch institutions are regulated by the Archives Act and its modifications since then (Amendment CXL of 1997. Enacting Clauses 19 and 20/1198. MKM), the Data Protection Act (LXIII of 1992) and the Privacy Act (LXV of 1995). One of the most important regulations concerning personal data of an individual mentioned in the records is that these data must not be published sooner than 30 years following the death of the person concerned, or if the year of death is unknown, for 90 years following the birth of the person concerned, or if both dates are unknown, for 60 years following the date of issue of the archival material concerned. “Personal data” is defined as any data that can be related to a certain natural person (“person concerned”) and any conclusion that can be drawn from such data about the person concerned.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Hungary**\r\n\r\n**C. I. In Hungary**\r\n\r\nIn Hungary, EHRI has so far identified a significant number of archival institutions, which are relevant for Holocaust research. EHRI has carried out archival descriptions in several of them: the Budapest-based Hungarian National Archives, the Budapest Municipal Archives, the Historical Archives of the Hungarian State Security, the Military History Archives, the Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives; the Holocaust Memorial Center; and the Pest County Archives.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nArchival sources pertaining to the Holocaust in Hungary can be found in the archives of all seven neighbouring countries (Austria, Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia) as well as in other foreign countries, most importantly Germany, Israel and the United States. Key foreign archives holding material pertaining to the Holocaust in Hungary include the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Archives, the Yad Vashem Archives, the Bundesarchiv, and the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington DC. While most records are written in Hungarian, finding aids and working languages differ in all these places. This continues to pose a serious challenge to researchers. Consequently, the identification and investigation of these archival documents require extensive international cooperation.\r\n",

The Israel State Archives also authorize and supervise the country‘s private archives.\r\n",
                "summary": "Israeli archives store important Holocaust-relevant collections. They include vast amounts of personal documentation brought to the country by refugees and survivors of the Holocaust, as well as testimonies given by survivors during and after the war. These testimonies describe the survivors’ experiences in the ghettos, camps, hideaways and with the partisans. It is important to point out that refugees and immigrants in Mandatory Palestine corresponded with relatives still living in their countries of origin. The letters from their relatives contain important information regarding the situation in these countries before and during the Nazi-occupation and the immediate post-war period.\r\n\r\nThe Yad Vashem Archives, whose official activities date back to 1946, holds the largest number of Holocaust-related collections by far. When the Israeli Parliament entrusted Yad Vashem with the mission to commemorate the Shoah and its victims in 1953, Yad Vashem began to systematically collect Holocaust-related documentation from all kinds of sources.\r\n\r\nThe first documents arrived at Yad Vashem from the “Historical Commissions” and various documentation centres established after the war, mostly by Holocaust survivors, but also from public institutions, researchers and private individuals. Material collected in Israel was added to the documentation collected by Jews during the war in the ghettos, camps and hideaways, as well as materials collected in the first years after the war, for example in DP camps. Since its establishment, the Yad Vashem Archives have initiated activities with a view to collecting and copying Holocaust-related documents that have been housed in various archives in Europe and throughout the world. Over the years, they have collected extensive and comprehensive documentation in various forms. For more detailed information on the activities and holdings of the Yad Vashem Archives, see the extensive report.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Yad Vashem, the Ghetto Fighters House, the Massuah Institute for the Study of the Holocaust, the Moreshet Mordechai Anielevich Memorial and the Kiddush Hashem Archive are important institutions that hold and collect Holocaust-related sources. Historically, these institutions were connected to different political movements. Furthermore, the Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People, the National Library of Israel, the Wiener Library for the Study of the Nazi Era and the Holocaust at Tel Aviv University, the Central Zionist Archives, the Jabotinsky Institute in Israel, Beit Theresienstadt, and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee should be mentioned here. Many more institutions in Israel hold Holocaust-related archives, such as the Leo Baeck Institute and the Lavon Institute for Labour Research. For more information on these institutions, see the extensive report. \r\n\r\nFinally, official documentation from the British authorities in Mandatory Palestine can be found in Israel, as well as documentation from Jewish organizations and public institutions of that period. These sources reflect the many ways in which immigrants arrived in Mandatory Palestine, and the hardships they endured, but also rescue attempts undertaken by both individual and political or public institutions.",

EHRI approach to Israel: Pre-existing research and third-party surveys, archival guides and expert support**\r\n\r\nIn Israel, EHRI was able to rely on and cooperate with Israel Archives Network, or RE'I Project of the National Library and State Archives in Israel which in 2013 conducted a survey, under the auspices of the Prime Minister's Office, to identify and map most archives in Israel. In the process, information was collected on archives holding Holocaust-related material, as well as on the documentation itself. The RE'I Project aimed at building an infrastructure, creating uniform standards for the archives in Israel, ensuring proper maintenance of documentation in various archives in Israel, and granting easy archival access to the public in Israel.\r\n\r\nThe RE’I Project has established that there are some 600 archives in Israel. Whether they hold Holocaust-relevant sources, and to what extent, was largely unknown before.\r\n\r\nIn the first implementation stage of the RE’I Project, a survey was conducted in all the archives that had been designated by the project steering committee. Surveyors were recruited to visit the various archives and to conduct an online survey via a dedicated survey system provided by Ransys Feedback Technologies. The survey was conducted over the course of a year. At the start of the survey, a list of 350 archives was available.\r\n\r\nCooperation between EHRI and RE'I, which was facilitated by Yad Vashem and started in the planning stages of the survey, allowed for the insertion of questions relating to the existence of Holocaust-related materials in the archives to be surveyed. The questions were designed to ascertain whether or not any Holocaust-related documentation existed in a particular archive; the nature of the documentation (personal documents, official documents, testimonies, memoirs); and the number of relevant collections in the archive. Likewise, the archives were asked to briefly describe the relevant collections and to provide their signatures.\r\n\r\nAbout 200 of the archives surveyed responded that they had Holocaust-related documentation. A large number of the archives also mentioned the types of existing documentation in their possession. Only a few, however, responded to questions regarding the number of relevant collections and their signatures. It appears that the reason for this is that many of the archives in Israel do not use the practice of registering documentation at the collection level, but rather at the file level. Another reason is the fact that some of the documentation is dispersed in files or collections pertaining to other topics. This hinders the identification and description of the documentation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, most of the relevant information gained from the RE'I survey pertains to the identification of Israeli archives holding various types of Holocaust-related material. In some cases there is also a very general description of the documentation. For the most part, it is difficult to extract quantitative data, collection signatures or detailed descriptions from the survey. Some of the archives are already included in the EHRI portal. More detailed information on the documentation in some of the archives, and its inclusion in the EHRI portal, will be possible once the archives become accessible in the framework of the RE'I project and the data is imported.\r\n\r\nBelow are examples of data provided by archives that participated in the survey, regarding Holocaust-related documentation in their possession. These examples represent the various types of archives in Israel: municipal or community archives – cities, communal settlements (moshavim), kibbutzim; archives of public and private organisations, institutions and political parties; and archives dedicated to a specific topic.\r\n\r\nMoshav and kibbutz archives primarily hold personal documentation of past and present members, refugees and Holocaust survivors, which is often kept in their personal files. The most prevalent types of documentation in these archives are testimonies and memoirs. Some of the archives have reported that the relevant material is scattered among various files and difficult to identify.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that some of the kibbutz and moshav members and some of the archives in these locations have submitted the originals or copies of the documentation in their possession to archives that primarily collect Holocaust-related documentation, such as Lohamei Haghetaot, Yad Ya'ari, Masuah and Moreshet. For example, the Yad Vashem Archives contain record group O.90 which includes documentation collected from kibbutzim. Since the survey did not include a question relating to original vs. copied documentation, it is difficult to say how much of the documentation is original. It should also be noted that some of the archives included information on Holocaust commemoration in their reports on Holocaust-related documentation.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- Kibbutz Beit Hashita archive – 50 items. Testimonies of survivors and orphans adopted by the kibbutz. There is also material on the absorption of youth groups and groups that were trained in the kibbutz and went on to establish other kibbutzim.\r\n- Kfar Yehoshua archive – requests for certificates; documentation of the youth groups that arrived from Germany and Romania, documentation in members' personal files.\r\n- Kibbutz Hafetz Haim archive – 16 files. Testimonies of kibbutz members, most of whom were Holocaust survivors.\r\n- Kibbutz Mayanot archive – 25 testimonies; letters of Yosef Kaplan, Shomer Hatzair emissary in Warsaw, who perished in the Holocaust and who corresponded with kibbutz members; documentation on Haviva Reich and other kibbutz members.\r\n- Kibbutz Hatzerim archive – 60 items. File on the Teheran children; information on kibbutz members who were Holocaust survivors.\r\n- Yad Ya'ari Hashomer Hatzair Archive – about 20 collections, including Hashomer Hatzair in Poland; Hashomer Hatzair in Yugoslavia; the bureau in Paris; Hashomer Hatzair worldwide; personal collections of Abba Kovner, Shalom Cholawski, Chaika Grossman, the sculptor Nathan Rapoport.\r\n- Machon Lavon Labor Movement Archive – 2 collections. The Hehalutz liaison office in Geneva - Nathan Schwalb (Dror) archive; collection of certificates from the Holocaust period.\r\n- Maccabee Archive – personal stories of athletes from Vilna who were banned from the 1936 Olympics by the Nazi regime.\r\n- Yad Chaim Weizmann Archive – correspondence regarding requests for rescue and aid and memos describing the situation of the Jews in Europe.\r\n- Felicia Blumental Music Center archive – Huberman archive: personal correspondence of Bronislaw Huberman regarding the Nazi rise to power in Germany in the framework of a pan-European movement and correspondence with the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler regarding the banishment of Jews from cultural life in Germany due to the antisemitic policies of the Nazis.\r\n- Leo Baeck Institute for the Study of German and Central European Jewry archive – unknown number of unique and rare letters, diaries and personal testimonies from the Holocaust period.\r\n- Hebrew University archive – There is not an exact number of items. Pre-war acceptance applications from individuals who anticipated the future and attempted to escape from Europe; diplomas awarded to students; documentation of project \"Treasures of the Diaspora\": campaign to salvage materials during the war, especially towards its end in 1945 and afterwards, when it was possible to move freely in those areas. The university sent missions to salvage materials, books and archives of Jewish communities in Europe. The administrative documentation that was produced during the campaign is found in the archive and the materials themselves are today in the National Library and the Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Israeli archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nMany archives in Israel contain a great deal of personal documentation, created or preserved by victims and survivors of the Holocaust, which reflects their experiences. Refugees and survivors had or have a variety of personal papers in their possession which reflect their experiences before, during and after the Shoah. They also document their histories and the events they witnessed in their former places of residence in Europe. A large portion of this material has been deposited and new material continues to arrive at various archives throughout Israel.\r\n\r\nAn increasing awareness of the great importance of Holocaust-era personal documentation held by private individuals in Israel has led the archives of Yad Vashem and the Ghetto Fighters' House in recent years to appeal to the Israeli public to deposit such documentation in their archives. These campaigns have resulted in the addition of thousands of items, mostly original documents, to the archives' collections.\r\n\r\nThe Yad Vashem Law, enacted by the Israeli Parliament in 1953, defined the institution’s mission as “to collect, examine and publish testimony of the disaster and the heroism it called forth…”, thus commemorating the Shoah and its victims. As a result, the Yad Vashem Archives were established which have collected Holocaust-related documentation from various sources ever since. However, efforts to document the Holocaust had begun long before 1953. From the Nazi rise to power in Germany, and throughout the Second World War, people documented the events as they were taking place, often under the harshest conditions. Even before the enormity of the disaster became clear, Mordechai Shenhavi initiated a Commemorative Project for the Jews of Europe that would include an archive. The Yad Vashem Archives officially started operating in 1946, under the direction of Dr. Sarah Friedlander, who had been born in Budapest and saved on the Kasztner train. The first documents arrived at Yad Vashem from the “Historical Commissions” and various documentation centres, as well as public institutions, researchers and private individuals. Material collected in Israel was added to the documentation collected by Jews during the war in the ghettos, camps and hideaways. Immediately after the war, centres for documentation and the collection of testimonies were established in many places around the world, including Munich, Warsaw, Lodz, Lublin, Paris, Bratislava, Budapest and other locations.\r\n\r\nSince their establishment, the Yad Vashem Archives have initiated activities with a view to collecting and copying Holocaust-related documents that have been housed in various archives in Europe and throughout the world. With the fall of the “Iron Curtain” and the opening of archives in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s, the reproduction project has been greatly expanded.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results in Israel**\r\n\r\nAfter decades of collecting Holocaust-relevant sources and original research in the field, Yad Vashem is clearly the most important record-holding institution in Israel. With over 210,000,000 pages of documentation it stores the largest collection of Holocaust documents in the world. The collections include over 131,000 survivor testimonies; over 500,000 photographs and approximately 4.8 million names registered in the Hall of Names.\r\n\r\nIt was crucial to include collection data held by Yad Vashem in the EHRI portal. In EHRI’s first phase, It was decided to divide the work into two steps. In the first step, descriptions of record groups and sub-record groups existing in the Yad Vashem database were manually added to the EHRI portal. Alongside the addition of the descriptions to the portal, dozens of authority entries were developed – especially personalities and organizations – which were later linked to the appropriate collection descriptions. In the second step, we added about 47 record groups and sub-record groups comprising 11,000 units of description in an IT-driven integration process.\r\n\r\nIn EHRI’s second phase, the export activity of Yad Vashem had two goals. Firstly, EHRI wanted to update Yad Vashem’s existing content on the EHRI portal, improve the quality of the descriptions and add new records. Secondly, the goal was to have a sustainable connection between Yad Vashem and the EHRI portal, allowing content updates and additions of new material on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, an additional 45 record groups, which have an internal hierarchical structure, have been exported to the portal. There were several challenges in the export process, including the definition of the export structure and standardization of the data; development of new workflows while bearing in mind that they should be designed to allow automatization in the future; and the creation of a new service in the Yad Vashem digital infrastructure for publishing data in a sustainable way.\r\n\r\nThe team used the EAD conversion tool provided by EHRI to create the EAD files as it allows for the creation of the EADs in a way which is consistent with the constraints requested by the EHRI project.\r\n\r\nThe EAD records were published using the Metadata Publication Tool provided by EHRI. This tool allows exposure of the EAD records for harvesting. The export was done in two languages, Hebrew and English, and is available in the portal. During EHRI-3, and following the changes to the data integration infrastructure introduced during this phase, the data exchange workflow was further sustained by the development of a bespoke API by YV, ensuring future updates of their archival descriptions. More than 1,400 additional record groups have been exported to the portal. Currently, the record groups are being linked to the corresponding record groups in other institutions present on the EHRI portal, since most of these record groups are copied collections acquired by the Yad Vashem archive.  \r\n\r\nApart from Yad Vashem there are many other repositories in Israel that hold Holocaust-related documentation and collect materials on this subject. Such archives include (in a non-exhaustive fashion):\r\n\r\n*American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, Jerusalem Branch*\r\n\r\nFounded during the First World War, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) was the first Jewish organisation in the United States to dispense large-scale funding for international relief. In its wake, the First World War had sown the seeds of many additional catastrophes—pogroms, epidemics, famine, revolution, and economic ruin—and JDC played a major role in rebuilding the devastated communities of Eastern Europe and Mandatory Palestine. JDC’s relief activities, emigration aid, and rescue operations critically followed the Nazi rise to power and the outbreak of the Second World War. After the war, JDC supported and resettled survivors and help rebuild the remnant Jewish communities of Europe. The JDC Archives house one of the most significant collections in the world for the study of modern Jewish history. The JDC Archives are located in two centres, one at JDC’s New York headquarters and the second in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n*Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People*\r\n\r\nThe Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People (CAHJP), established in 1939, is now a subsidiary of the National Library of Israel. This archive includes millions of pages of original and copied documentation related to Jewish communities, including information about those communities before, during, and after World War II. For instance, they hold 1,600 archives of hundreds of Jewish communities, local, national and international Jewish organisations and private collections of many outstanding Jewish personalities. Today, this archive contains the most extensive collection of documents, pinkassim (registers) and other records of Jewish history from the Middle Ages to the present day.\r\n\r\n*Central Zionist Archives*\r\n\r\nThe Zionist Archives were founded in 1919 in Berlin. With the rise to power of the Nazis in 1933, the Archives were transferred to the Jewish Agency building in Jerusalem. Over the years, the collections expanded and after the Second World War an increased effort was made to bring the scarce archival material that had survived the war to Israel. In 1956, the 24th Zionist Congress declared the Central Zionist Archives to be the historic archives of the Zionist Movement, of the World Zionist Organization and of the Jewish Agency. The Central Zionist Archives act as the historic archives of the World Zionist Organization, the Jewish Agency, the Jewish National Fund, the United Israel Appeal and the World Jewish Congress. In addition, they hold archives of organisations and institutions of the Jewish population in the Land of Israel, as well as 1,500 personal archives, including on the heads and leaders of the Zionist Movement and the national funds and various personalities who have been active in the Zionist movement.\r\n\r\n*Ganzach Kiddush Hashem Archive*\r\n\r\nThe Kiddush Hashem Archive (in Hebrew, Ganzach Kiddush Hashem), an Orthodoxy-affiliated Holocaust institution, was founded in 1964 by the Holocaust researcher Rabbi Moshe Prager \"with the aim of commemorating the destroyed Jewish world, the heroism of the Jewish soul during the Holocaust, and the miracle of the Jewish People’s rebirth in Israel\". For 60 years the archive has gathered about 300,000 photographs in the Photograph Archive, about 2,000,000 documents in the Document Archive, approximately 40,000 textbooks in the Library as well as about 2000 video testimonies.\r\n\r\n*Ghetto Fighters' House*\r\n\r\nThe Ghetto Fighters' House – Itzhak Katzenelson Holocaust and Jewish Resistance Heritage Museum, an institution historically affiliated with the Zionist Labour movement, was founded in 1949 by a community of Holocaust survivors, members of the Jewish underground in the ghettos of Poland, and veterans of partisan units, to be a place of testimony that would tell the story of the Jewish People in the 20th century in general, and during the Second World War in particular. At the centre of this chronicle are the manifestations of Jewish resistance: the organised uprisings of Jews in the ghettos and camps, and the Jews who fought in partisan units and the armies of the Allied forces. The Ghetto Fighters’ House archive holds over 2,500,000 objects, including letters, certificates, diaries and testimonies (written, audio and video), films, photographs and displays. The archive collections comprise the history of the Jewish nation on all five continents during the first half of the 20th century and cover a wide range of areas such as the spiritual life, traditions and religion, society, education, economics, Holocaust and resistance, and the nation’s revival in the Land of Israel.\r\n\r\n*Jabotinsky Institute in Israel*\r\n\r\nThe Jabotinsky Institute in Israel was founded in 1937 with the aim of collecting and serving as a repository for documents, publications and photographic material associated with Ze'ev Jabotinsky and the Revisionist Movement. Today, about 400 personal archives of Ze'ev Jabotinsky and his family are stored in the Institute, as well as archives of the leaders of the Revisionist Movement. In addition, the collection includes 215 archives relating to the various branches of the National Movement and its institutions such as the Union of Zionists Revisionists (Hatzohar); The New Zionist Organization (N.Z.O); The Betar Youth movement and its Israeli and international branches; The National Labor Federation; and Keren Tel-Hai.\r\n\r\n*Massuah Institute for the Study of the Holocaust*\r\n\r\nThe Massuah Institute, an institution historically affiliated with the Zionist liberal Progressive Party, contains a museum and an international seminar centre designed to evoke discourse on the significance of the Holocaust in our contemporary society and culture. The Document Archive comprises a collection of documents and publications related to the Holocaust, the Jewish world prior to the Holocaust – community institutions, youth movements and collections of personal documents. It is the chief archive of the history of the Hanoar Hazioni and Akiva youth movements. The documents are arranged according to subject in 12 units. Among them are unique collections of postal items from the time of the Holocaust, personal testimonies of Holocaust survivors and personal archives.\r\n\r\n*Moreshet*\r\n\r\nEstablished in 1961, Moreshet, Mordechai Anielevich Memorial Holocaust Study and Research Centre, affiliated with the Hashomer Hatzair movement, is dedicated to the commemoration of Jewish organised resistance during the Second World War and the Holocaust. The Moreshet archive holds a vast body of testimonies – personal and collective, collected in the years following the liberation and later on. The unique documents preserved in the Moreshet archive include many documents relating to the underground movement that operated in the Vilna ghetto, the pioneer underground in Hungary, documentation of the Slovakian revolt and other documents about the support and rescue of Jewish refugees during and after the war. Another interesting section in the archive is a collection of more than a hundred personal war diaries, which give a direct insight into the experiences and feelings of their writers. Finally, it holds a fascinating collection of arts and craft works that survived the war.\r\n\r\n*National Library of Israel*\r\n\r\nThe National Library of Israel includes a growing number of collections, such as but not limited to:\r\n- A nearly complete collection of secondary literature on the Holocaust in tens of languages\r\n- Archives of individual cultural heroes, artists, scholars, and authors who perished in the Holocaust, emigrated or fled due to rising European anti-Semitism, survived the Holocaust, or created art and culture related to the Holocaust (including documents from Stefan Zweig, Avraham Sutzkever and the cultural life in the Vilna Ghetto, Anita Shapira, and others)\r\n- Archival material related to the Land of Israel during WWII and Jewish Soldiers during the war, as well as the relocation of survivors to Palestine and later the State of Israel\r\n- Several oral history collections and ethnographic recordings related to the Holocaust and its survivors, particularly but not exclusively materials gathered by the Oral History Division of the Hebrew University\r\n- A music collection that includes thousands of recordings of Holocaust related music\r\n- Collections of published material by and for the She'erit Hapelatah, including ritual texts, newspapers, children's books, and others, including a complete set of the Survivors' Talmud \r\n- Several diaries of Holocaust survivors, including that of Menachem Oppenheim written in the margins of his prayer book\r\n- The Historical Jewish Press site, includes hundreds of thousands of pages of full-text searchable Jewish newspapers from Europe and around the world from the 1930s and 1940s\r\n- Meta-data about some of the items in the collections that were distributed by Jewish Cultural Reconstruction\r\n- The USC Shoah Foundation (USC SFI) has partnered with the National Library of Israel to provide Israeli users with the first countrywide access to USC SFI's entire Visual History Archive, including testimonies from more than 52,000 Holocaust survivors and hundreds of survivors of the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks\r\n\r\n*Beith Theresienstadt*\r\n\r\nBeit Terezin archives contain original documents in addition to photocopies of documents stored in other institutions, all pertaining to the ghetto period, and including a catalogue listing details of about 160,000 prisoners of Ghetto Theresienstadt. Over 900 files are classified under topics such as: art, literature, self-administration, medicine, labor department, children’s homes, children’s comics, music, academic studies, research, personal testimonies, and biographical information.\r\n\r\nAn integral part of the archive is the library which contains about 5,000 books, periodicals, catalogues, sheets of music composed and performed in the ghetto, documentary films, audio recordings, in Hebrew and other languages.\r\n\r\nThe world’s largest collection of drawings, paintings and sculptures created by adults and children while they were interned in Ghetto Theresienstadt is perhaps the “backbone” of the archive, and also includes Judaica objects and everyday objects.\r\n\r\n*The Wiener Library for the Study of the Nazi era and the Holocaust at Tel Aviv University*\r\n\r\nThe Wiener Library for the Study for the Study of the Nazi Era and the Holocaust is a steadily growing research library and comprises old and new publications on the Third Reich, during and between the two world wars, Jewish communities in Europe, the Holocaust, anti-Semitism, and fascism throughout the world. As a research library affiliated to the Sourasky Central Library of Tel Aviv University, it offers access to extensive archival sources, books, journals, and databases for researchers worldwide. The library continues to develop and enhance its collections, provides guidance in retrieving information and locating material, initiates conferences, seminars and lecture series, encourages and coordinates research projects, and collaborates with scholars, research institutes, archives and other research libraries.\r\n\r\n*Shem Olam, Faith and the Holocaust Institute for Education Documentation and Research*\r\n\r\nThe Shem Olam Institute has harnessed itself and others to carry out research using historical scientific tools, while uncovering documents and unfamiliar sources relating to the world of values, faith, religious and spiritual life, which focus attention on coping in the Holocaust. \r\n\r\nThe EHRI Portal furthermore provides collection descriptions from the Leo Baeck Institute and other institutions.

Leg. 22 gennaio 2004 n. 42, “Codice dei beni culturali e del paesaggio”, https://storico.beniculturali.it/mibac/export/MiBAC/sito-MiBAC/Contenuti/Norme-e-Pareri/Evidenza/visualizza_asset.html_1095508472.html), the General Direction of the Archives [Direzione generale degli Archivi – DGA] is in charge of coordinating the activities for the protection, conservation and enhancement of the national archival heritage. The DGA works under the Italian Ministry of Culture - MIC (https://cultura.gov.it/). The DGA leads and supervises an extended network of public institutions, which includes:\r\n- the Italian Central Institute for the Archives [Istituto centrale per gli Archivi – ICAR] which promotes and supports the enhancement of the archival heritage through thematic projects and ICT development;\r\n- the Central State Archives [Archivio Centrale dello Stato - ACS] in Rome, which preserve documentation created by the central political and administrative bodies of the State, including the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, ministries, judicial and advisory bodies;\r\n- 19 Regional Archival Superintendencies [Soprintendenze Archivistiche]: Every Region has a “Soprintendenza Archivistica” or in some cases a “Soprintendenza archivistica e bibliografica). See the full list here: https://cultura.gov.it/enti/soprintendenze-archivistiche-e-bibliografiche;\r\n- 101 State Archives [Archivi di Stato, AS], located in each of the Italian Provinces and in some major centres.

Leg. 22 gennaio 2004 n. 42, arts. 10, 13). The Ministry for the Foreign Affairs, the General Staffs of Army, Defence, Navy and Airforce, the Presidency of the Republic, the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate hold and manage their historical documentation in their own archives and are thus not supervised by the DGA.",
                "summary": "EHRI has so far identified over 90 archival institutions which hold Holocaust-relevant resources in Italy. These institutions can be roughly divided into public institutions such as the City Archives [Archivi Comunali], the State Archives (Archivi di Stato), the [Central State Archive [Archivio Centrale dello Stato]](https://www.esercito.difesa.it/storia/Ufficio-Storico-SME), the [Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [Archivio del Ministero degli Affari Esteri]](https://www.esteri.it/it/uapsds/archivio-storico-e-biblioteca/archivio-storico-diplomatico/), and the [Archives of the Army General Staff [Archivio Storico dell’Esercito]](https://www.esercito.difesa.it/storia/Ufficio-Storico-SME). The Archives of the Army General Staff allows limited access only. Furthermore, there are private archives such as the Parish and Diocesan Archives [Archivi Parrocchiali e Diocesani, which belong to the Catholic Church] and the Archives of the Jewish Communities [Archivi delle Comunità Ebraiche] of which the Rome, Florence and Venice branches hold particularly significant Holocaust-related collections. The Institutes for the History of the Resistance Movement network [Istituti per la storia della Resistenza], which has a [central seat in Milan](https://www.reteparri.it/) and a leading institute in Turin, holds records on the period 1943-1945 and focuses on documenting anti-fascist activity. The leading archive for documents concerning anti-Jewish persecutions in Italy is the Foundation Jewish Contemporary Documentation Center [CDEC, Fondazione Centro di Documentazione Ebraica Contemporanea] in Milan. The Center has produced the most detailed database documenting the history of the Italian Jews during the Holocaust period, which is now also available online (see below). [The National Museum of Italian Jewry and the Shoah [Museo Nazionale dell’Ebraismo Italiano e della Shoah, MEIS]](https://meis.museum/) in Ferrara and the Museum of the Shoah [Museo della Shoah] in Rome, are under construction and, for this reason, have not yet been the object of EHRI’s survey work.\r\n\r\nOutside of Italy, EHRI found that the State Archives in Rijeka, Croatia, have four collections pertaining to the Holocaust period. Especially important, however, are the vast holdings on Italy, which EHRI was able to identify at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.",
                "extensive": "Disclaimer: The EHRI Extensive Report was updated in 2024.\r\n\r\n**A. EHRI approach to Italy: Pre-existing research, archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nLacking a pre-existing specific, thematic guide about Holocaust documentation in Italy, the EHRI approach to Italy was based on two pillars. The first focused on the collections held by the Foundation Jewish Contemporary Documentation Center (CDEC). The bulk of research on the Holocaust in Italy has been carried out by the scholars of this institution, which began collecting documents in the 1960s and now holds a large number of copy collections from many of the Italian State Archives. These fragments have been used as a directory for deeper investigation in their originating institutions. The second pillar focused on research concerning the persecution of the Jews in Italy.\r\n\r\nGeneral guides to the Italian archival heritage are available on both paper and in digital format. See, for example, the *General Guide to the State Archives* [*Guida generale degli Archivi di Stato*, a cura di Claudio Pavone, Piero D’Angiolini, Roma, 1966-1969], which is also available online through a dedicated platform where information can be easily searched: http://www.guidageneralearchivistato.beniculturali.it/\r\n\r\nAs for the diocesan archives, a useful paper guide has been published as a special issue of the Journal *Rassegna degli Archivi di Stato in 1998. See, Guida degli Archivi diocesan d’Italia*, a cura di V. Monachino, E. Boaga, L. Osbat, S. Palese, Roma, Ministero per i beni culturali e ambientali. Ufficio centrale per i Beni Archivistici, 1998.\r\n\r\nThe Central State Archives provides access to interviews from the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education with Italian Holocaust survivors, available through the online portal Ti racconto la storia: voci dalla Shoah: http://www.shoah.acs.beniculturali.it/.\"\r\n\r\nEHRI has found the web portal of the Archival Superintendencies, Sistema Informativo Unificato per le Soprintendenze Archivistiche (SIUSA) particularly useful for navigating the archives of local Jewish communities: http://siusa.archivi.beniculturali.it/. In particular, it is worth mentioning that there is athe  thematic section devoted to the Archives for the Jewish history (Archivi per la storia dell’ebraismo):  https://siusa-archivi.cultura.gov.it/cgi-bin/siusa/pagina.pl?RicProgetto=ebrais\r\n\r\nOn the SIUSA web portal, there is also a useful “Guide to Archives of the Resistance” [Guida agli Archivi della Resistenza]: http://siusa.archivi.beniculturali.it/cgi-bin/pagina.pl?TipoPag=strumcorr&Chiave=27763. As for the numerous collections of the Institutes for the History of the Resistance, their collections can be browsed through an integrated web portal at: http://www.reteparri.it/patrimonio/\r\n\r\nApart from SIUSA, other databases and web-portals that have been useful in the identification of Holocaust-relevant archival institutions and collections include Sistema Archivistico Nazionale – http://san.beniculturali.it – as well as Sistema Informativo degli Archivi di Stato (SIAS): http://sias.archivi.beniculturali.it/cgi-bin/pagina.pl?RicVM=archivi\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Italian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAs a systematic cataloguing of Holocaust-related material scattered throughout Italian archival institutions has not yet been done at a national nor local level, a good knowledge of the history of the Italian administrative bodies together with authoritative historiographical works can help in the task of the identification of Holocaust related material. High and medium level archival descriptions – in some cases also full inventories – of the documentation held by the wide network of public and private institutions in Italy are available online thanks to an integrated and continuously updated web portal, the National Archival System [Sistema Archivistico Nazionale, SAN]. It works as a national access point to information on archival resources . However, these descriptions are often insufficient to identify the collections within which Holocaust-related documentation is present. For example, the Central State Archives in Rome hold a large amount of documentation about all aspects of persecution of the Jews, but this is only partially reported in both the online and paper finding aids. The same goes for the State Archives, where scholars can definitely find useful documentation in the “Questura” and “Prefettura” fonds, even though the finding aids do not always mention the presence of this kind of material.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is important to note that there have been a number of initiatives and projects aimed to make material and documentation about the Holocaust accessible to a wider audience in recent years. For example, the State Archives of Venice are digitising documents related to the persecution of the Jews in Venice; the State Archives of Trieste are working on a project aiming to describe and index their Holocaust related documentation (especially those related to the Coroneo prison, which are very important for the identification of the victims arrested and/or deported from Trieste; and the Municipal (or City) Archives of Milan are reordering their collection on the full 1938 Racial census (more than 3,500 papers, which refer to every Jewish family residing in Milan) and are planning to write descriptions for this documentation.\r\n\r\nWhile both the Central State Archives and regional State Archives hold documentation that enables research on the administrative machinery behind the persecution of the Jews, researchers can find material documenting the impact of this persecution from the victims’ perspectives at Jewish institutions and archives. This is the case of the Foundation “Contemporary Jewish Documentation Center” [Fondazione Centro di Documentazione Ebraica Contemporanea, CDEC], whose collections and databases are primarily focused on the personal documents and testimonies of Holocaust victims and partisan Jews. The historical Archives of the Union of the Italian Jewish Community [Unione delle Comunità ebraiche Italiane, UCEI] provides documentation about the reactions of the top Jewish political and administrative management to the Fascist regime, racial laws and persecution, as well post-war policies and activities for rebuilding the Italian Jewish communities after the Holocaust. It also holds relevant documentation about the relationships established with the State administrative bodies. This kind of documentation can be found at the historical archives of almost every Italian Jewish community archive, especially those of the major urban centres – Rome, Milan, Turin, Florence, Venice and Trieste. For these major centres, the principal Jewish institutions and archives are the CDEC Foundation; the Historical Archives of the Jewish Community of Rome (https://ascer.roma.it/); the Carlo and Vera Wagner Museum in Trieste; the Library Archive Renato Maestro in Venice (http://renatomaestro.org/it/); the Benvenuto and Umberto Terracini Archives in Turin (https://www.archivioterracini.it/patrimonio/archivi/); and the Historical Archives of the Jewish Community of Florence (https://www.firenzebraica.it/biblioteca-e-archivio/).\r\n\r\nThe National Museum of Italian Jewry and the Shoah [Museo Nazionale dell’Ebraismo Italiano e della Shoah, MEIS] in Ferrara as well as the Museum of the Shoah [Museo della Shoah] in Rome are under construction and they are still collecting material and documents, while the Memoriale della Shoah in Milan does not collect documents.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these two main categories of archival institutions, there is a third, more diverse group of private institutions that offer valuable documentation and information about the Holocaust in Italy. Notably, there is a network of 64 Institutes for the History of the Resistance Movement (Rete degli Istituti per la storia della Resistenza e dell’età contemporanea) spread across Italy and coordinated by the Istituto Nazionale Ferruccio Parri in Milan (formerly the Istituto Nazionale per la Storia del Movimento di Liberazione in Italia). The Archive of the Fondazione Memoria della Deportazione contains extensive materials and documentation on antifascist deportees. There are also numerous Catholic Parish and Diocesan archives. The Istituto Luce Cinecittà, the leading institute for audiovisual materials from the 1920s to the 1960s, holds a rich collection. The historical archives of the former Banca Commerciale Italiana, now part of the Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Group (with archival branches in Milan, Turin, Rome, and Bologna), contain a wealth of documentation related to the confiscation and restitution of Jewish assets, notably the Fondo EGELI (Ente di Gestione e Liquidazione Immobiliare). (https://asisp.intesasanpaolo.com/egeli/archive-fond/egeli). Since 2024, Intesa Sanpaolo's EGELI data have been available in Linked Open Data format at the following link: https://dati-asisp.intesasanpaolo.com/lod/resource/Dataset/BeniEbraici.html.\r\nAdditional documentation concerning EGELI is also available at the Fondazione 1563 Archive in Turin (https://archiviostorico.fondazione1563.it/oggetti/98550-iii-gestioni-egeli-ente-di-gestione-e-liquidazione-immobiliare-dell-istituto-di-san-paolo-di-torino/). Lastly, for insights into Jewish commercial and industrial activities in Italy, the historical archives of local Chambers of Commerce, one in each province, could prove useful.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI Identification and description of results**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Italy**\r\n\r\nAs a result of the identification process in Italy, EHRI has been able to provide descriptions for over 90 institutions. In particular, EHRI began with the identification of collections at the Central State Archives (ACS), local State Archives (AS), and the CDEC Foundation.\r\n\r\nIn general terms, the ACS collections hold documentation concerning the measures taken by the Fascist administration against the Jews while the material held by the local State Archives documents the practical implementation of such measures at the local level. At the Central State Archives, EHRI carried out identification work on the following six collections:\r\n- Ministero degli Interni [Ministry of Interior]\r\n- Ministero delle Finanze [Financial Ministry]\r\n- Ministero della Cultura Popolare [Ministry of Popular Culture]\r\n- Archivi fascisti [Fascist Archives]\r\n- EGELI – Ente Gestione e Liquidazione Immobiliare\r\n- Ministero per l’assistenza post-bellica [Ministry for Post-War Assistance]\r\n\r\nDescribing these collections provides an extensive and multifaceted overview of the material created by ministries and administrative bodies during the Fascist years and after the war. However, given the extent of these collections, the survey and the identification of Holocaust-related material at the ACS is far from complete.\r\n\r\nRegarding the local State Archives, the fonds “Questura” and “Prefettura” of each of the nearly 30 local State Archives which have collection descriptions have been found particularly relevant in documenting the various phases and measures taken by the Fascist regime against the Jews in Italy – Italian and foreigners – from 1938 to 1945.\r\n\r\nThe combination of documentation from the Central State Archives and local State Archives paints a rather detailed picture of how the administrative machine worked at both central and local levels. On the other hand, the documentation imported into the EHRI portal from Jewish institutions and archives – including the Union of the Italian Jewish Communities, several local Jewish Communities and the CDEC Foundation – provides perspectives of those persecuted by the Fascist regime and their reactions to such measures.\r\n\r\nThe CDEC Foundation’s collecting policies have focused on obtaining documentation linked to the persecution of the Jews and Jewish participation in the Resistance. Consequently, the Foundation’s materials focus on individuals and their testimonies about their psychological and physical suffering. From this perspective, the paper collections “Vicissitudini dei singoli”, “CRDE – Comitato Ricerche Deportati Ebrei” and “Massimo Adolfo Vitale” are particularly interesting, as is its photographic collection [“Collezione Fotografie Vittime della Shoah”], and its collection of audio and video interviews [“Testimonianze sulla Shoah”], which the CDEC has been recording since the early 1980s. In addition to the collections cited above, the documents created by the CDEC Foundation on the occasion of the trial (1964-1973) against Friedrich Boßhammer – the Nazi officer responsible for the mass deportation of Jews from Italy – also deserve a special mention. On that occasion, CDEC was in charge of collecting both direct survivor testimonies as well as documentation from several local State Archives in order to assist in the prosecution of Boßhammer. Most of this documentation is now gathered both in the collections “Processo Bosshammer” and “Collezione Archivi Italiani e stranieri”.\r\n\r\nApart from these main lines of inquiry, EHRI has also provided top and medium level descriptions from the Archives of the Union of the Italian Jewish Communities (UCEI) (http://archiviostorico.ucei.it/ucei-web/). The UCEI’s collections give a wide overview of the activities of the Italian Jewish leadership from the 1930s until the end of the war and the years afterward. Among other things these collections are particularly relevant from the point of view of the relationship between the Union and the Fascist government. Furthermore, it provides a rich corpus of documents regarding the measures of assistance towards Jewish refugees since the early 1930s.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Italy, material relevant to the Holocaust in Italy can be found in a number of institutions, including the German Bundesarchiv, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University, and Yad Vashem in Israel.",

Consequently, most of them are based on the Soviet system of cataloging and most of the inventory files are written in Russian to this day. There are other archival institutions that were established or restructured after Kyrgyzstan’s independence. The former Archive of the Communist Party of Kyrgyzstan was renamed the Central State Archive of Social-Political Documentation. It holds a considerable collection of decrees related to the evacuation, the war effort and the history of the Jews. As a result of regime changes and administrative reforms, some archival institutions in Kyrgyzstan have been renamed, which may cause some initial confusion among researchers.\r\n\r\n**C.

A somewhat smaller number of fonds have been found and described in other Lithuanian archival institutions. The Vilna Gaon  Museum of Jewish History has collections with Holocaust-relevant material.

EHRI approach to Lithuania: Pre-existing research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nEHRI’s exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in Lithuania could rely on some important pre-existing research in the field, such as Christoph Dieckmann’s *Deutsche Besatzungspolitik in Litauen 1941-1944* (2011), which makes extensive use of archival material available in the country. EHRI also worked closely with the Vilna Gaon Museum of Jewish History in Vilnius, which became a consortium partner during EHRI’s second phase. Thanks to the support of this institution, EHRI has been able to identify important collections in over ten different institutions. There is one helpful archival guide on Holocaust-relevant sources in the Lithuanian Central State Archive, which is written in both Lithuanian and English:\r\n\r\n- [2011] Žirikova, Galina, *Lietuvos centrinio valstybės archyvo fondai: holokausto Lietuvoje tyrimo šaltinis* (*The Collections of the State Archive of Lithuania: a Source of Research on the Holocaust in Lithuania*), Vilnius: Valstybinis Vilniaus Gaono Žydų Muziejus, 2011.\r\n\r\nLitvakSIG (Lithuanian-Jewish Special Interest Group) is the primary internet resource for Lithuanian-Jewish (Litvak) genealogy research worldwide. All the data is available via the All Lithuania Database, a freely searchable database which has more than 2,500,000 records transcribed and translated from various archival institutions in Lithuania and abroad:\r\n- https://www.litvaksig.org/\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Lithuania’s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAn important number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created or are deposited in Lithuania and can still be found in the country’s archives today. The Chief Archivist’s Office allows free access to all fonds. Some restrictions may apply to files containing personal data, but even these can be used either by relatives of the persons named in such files, or for academic survey purposes after applying for a special permission to the archive’s director. Restricted source material cannot be published.\r\n\r\nOn a practical level, a working knowledge of Lithuanian and/or Russian is helpful for any kind of archival research in Lithuania, even though documents in other languages can also be found with the help of the local archival staff. Beyond that, archives in Lithuania offer a wide range of research tools, ranging from traditional card index catalogues to electronic catalogues. The digitalisation of file and fonds descriptions is in progress in most archives.\r\n\r\nConcerning Holocaust research, finding relevant documents can be difficult due to a certain lack of accuracy in available collection descriptions. EHRI’s expert on Lithuania estimates that only some 15% of all relevant descriptions actually contain the word \"Holocaust\", while the other 85%, which are potentially equally important, remain obscured. For instance, fonds on the Vilnius, Kaunas and Šiaulai ghettos are rather easy to find, while sources on the provincial regions of Lithuania are harder to come by. On the other hand, the Lithuanian Special Archives’ reading room offers an electronic register of participants in the Holocaust, such as Kaunas policemen in 1941/42. The names of participants and bystanders can be found, for instance, in survivor’s testimonies at the Lithuanian Central Archives. In the light of these findings, EHRI has made considerable headway in identifying and describing Holocaust-relevant collections in Lithuania, but the full potential of the country’s archival institutions remains to be determined. A survey of the collections held by small local museums in Lithuania, of private collections and of surviving photographs from the Holocaust period, is highly desirable.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Lithuania**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Lithuania**\r\n\r\nIn Lithuania, EHRI has identified over 10 archival institutions which hold Holocaust-related collections. Most of them are concentrated in the country’s capital, Vilnius. At the Lithuanian Central State Archives alone, EHRI has identified and described over 160 Holocaust-relevant collections, which contain, among others, sources produced by German District and Police Chiefs, various municipalities and prison administrations. At the other five Vilnius-based institutions, over 160 additional Holocaust-relevant collections have been identified and described so far. The Lithuanian Special Archives, for instance, contain the cases and trials of collaborators who persecuted Jews in Lithuania. The Vilna Gaon Museum of Jewish History, to which the Lithuanian Central State Archive has re-transferred a former collection in 1998 (parts of the LCVA fonds RG 1390 was catalogued under call number VŽM at the Museum) keeps records about Jews murdered in various Lithuanian cities, as well as relevant copied source material from archives in neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n**C.II.

                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Luxembourg: Pre-existing Research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nUntil recently Holocaust remained under-researched in Luxembourg, which was in part due to the fact that the country did not have its own university before 2003. Until then, academic research depended mainly on private endeavours undertaken abroad. Since the establishment of the university, two Holocaust-relevant conferences have taken place in Luxembourg, the results of which will be published shortly. Moreover, the Université de Luxembourg’s history department has launched a project to interview contemporary witnesses of the Second World War, which may lead to a number of Holocaust survivor testimonies. Furthermore, there is an exhibition catalogue on the “Exilland Luxemburg 1933-1947”, which deals with, among other things, racial refugees from Germany brought to Luxembourg during the 1930s, and resulted in the publication of Hugo Heumann’s memoirs, *Erlebtes und Erlittenes. Von Mönchengladbach über Luxemburg nach Theresienstadt. Tagebuch eines deutsch-jüdischen Emigranten* (2007). A catalogue on another exhibition shown in the Musée national de la Résistance under the title “Between Shade and Darkness. Le sort des Juifs du Luxembourg de 1940 à 1945” was reprinted in 2016. There is also a recent, albeit non-academic, publication on the Jews of Luxembourg, published by Laurent Moyse: *Du rejet à l’intégration. Histoire des Juifs du Luxembourg des origines à nos jours* (2011).\r\n\r\nWorking with the Centre de Documentation et Recherche sur la Résistance (which has since closed) and the contemporary history section of the National Archives of Luxembourg, EHRI’s on-site surveys identified key archival institutions and two helpful archival guides :\r\n\r\n- [2003/1995] Spang, Paul, *Etat général des fonds conservés aux Archives nationales du Grand Duché de Luxembourg et aux archives de la Section historique de l’Institut grand-ducal* (Luxembourg, Publications de la Section historique de l'Institut grand-ducal, vol. 112-113: tome 1 1995, tome 2 2003)\r\n\r\n- [1978] *Grand-Duché de Luxembourg: Archives de l'Etat. Inventaire détaillé des affiches de la deuxième guerre mondiale* (Luxembourg: Ministère des affaires culturelles, 1978)\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Luxembourg archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe main archives are the National Archives located in Luxembourg City. A law on the archives was passed in 2018. In general, access is granted to documents older than 30 years. The files originating from the Prosecutor General’s Office are only accessible with a special permission from the Prosecutor General. Luxembourg also has private archives. Holocaust-related collections held by the National Archives include material generated by Luxembourg’s administration (both at home and in exile), the German occupation authorities, financial agencies, Jewish bodies and post-war investigations. The National Archives have also acquired the collections of the Centre de Documentation et de Recherche sur la Résistance when it closed in 2016. The archives of the city of Luxembourg possess some files related to the synagogue and its destruction. The local archives of Grevenmacher, Mondorf, Esch/Alzette, Differdange, Dudelange, Ettelbruck, towns where Jewish communities existed before the German occupation of Luxembourg, may keep some files pertaining to these communities. The local archives of Wintger keep a card file of those Jews imprisoned in the small ghetto of Fünfbrunnen [Cinqfontaines] before their deportation.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Luxembourg**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Luxembourg**\r\n\r\nIn Luxembourg, EHRI has so far identified two significant archival institutions:\r\n\r\n- City Archives of Luxembourg [Archives de la Ville de Luxembourg]\r\n\r\n- National Archives of Luxemburg [Archives nationales de Luxembourg/Luxemburger Nationalarchiv]\r\n\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nIn the EHRI Portal, Luxembourg is also covered by a number of other archival institutions, mainly the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Archives Nationales de France et the Archives générales du Royaume et Archives de l'État dans les Provinces / Algemeen Rijksarchief en Rijksarchief in de Provinciën (Belgium).",

The role of the National Archives is to collect and store records with archival value; provide accessibility of these records; supervise the observance of records management in the institutions and in the accredited private archives; accredit private archives; and perform the other functions specified in Archives Law. Within the National Archives, the role of the State Historical Archives is to administer the National Documentary Heritage of the Latvian archival fonds of 1220–1945, which includes documents of state and local authorities; courts; estates; religious organizations; political and public organizations; documents of enterprises and other legal persons; and documents of private persons. The State Archives, on the other hand, are tasked with the collection and preservation of: documents of central governmental institutions (parliament, cabinets of ministers, and other institutions) of the Republic of Latvia; documents of the Rīga and Jūrmala municipal institutions; personal fonds of Latvia and of foreign countries; and archives of Latvian exile organizations. The State Archives also hold documents concerning Latvian Social democracy; documents of the Communist Party of Latvia; and documents from the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic’s Committee of State Security (KGB) about repressed persons.

                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Latvia: Pre-existing research, archival guides and expert support**\r\n\r\nEHRI’s exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in Latvia could rely on some important pre-existing research in the field, such as Katrin Reichelt’s *Lettland unter deutscher Besatzung 41-1944. Der lettische Anteil am Holocaust* (2011), and Andrej Angrick’s and Peter Klein’s *The Final Solution in Riga: Exploitation and Annihilation, 1941-1944* (2009).\r\n\r\nWorking extensively with the National Archives of Latvia, EHRI was able to identify important collections in three Riga-based archives: the National Archives of Latvia, State Historical Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacionālā arhīva Latvijas Valsts vēstures arhīvs, LNA LVVA]; the National Archives of Latvia, State Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacionālā arhīva Latvijas Valst arhīvs, LNA LVA]; and the Latvia State Archive of Audiovisual Documents [Latvijas Valsts kinofotofonodokumentu arhivs]. \r\n\r\nAn overview of Latvian State Archives, which is written in both Latvian and English and available in print and online, suggests that there are more Holocaust-relevant archives to discover, especially among the eleven Regional State Archives:\r\n\r\n- [2004] Bušmane, Inta/Maija Āboltin̦a (ed.), *Valsts arhīvi Latvijā / Latvia state archives* (Riga: Latvijas Valsts arhīvu g̕enerāldirekcija : \"Mantojums\", [2004]), (http://www.arhivi.lv/sitedata/VAS/Arhivu%20vesture/Latvijas%20valsts%20arhivi.pdf)\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Latvia’s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAn important number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created or have been deposited in Latvia and can still be found in the country’s archives today. Access to them appears to be unrestricted, but some limits to the use of personal data are to be expected. The most frequent languages of the sources are German, Russian and Latvian. On a practical level, a working knowledge of Latvian and/or Russian is probably necessary for any kind of archival research in Latvia, even though documents in other languages can also be found with the help of the local archival staff.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Latvia**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Latvia**\r\n\r\nHolocaust-relevant sources in Latvia are concentrated in the country’s capital, Riga and in two archives in particular:\r\n\r\n- the National Archives of Latvia, State Historical Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacionālā arhīva Latvijas Valsts vēstures arhīvs, LNA LVVA], which keeps mostly documents from the period until 1944, and\r\n\r\n- the National Archives of Latvia, State Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacionālā arhīva Latvijas Valst arhīvs, LNA LVA], which keep documents from the period since 1945.\r\n\r\nAt the State Historical Archives alone, EHRI has identified and described over 50 Holocaust-related fonds, some of which contain thousands of files pertaining to all of Latvia or to certain regions, districts and cities. The fonds identified and described by EHRI include collections of sources produced by German occupation and administrative authorities, such as the Reichskommissar Ostland or the SS and Police Leader in Latvia, but also ample sources left by local Latvian institutions, e.g. very extensive District Police records. The sources for the survey consisted of the, mostly printed, finding aids available at the archives. For example, the fonds of the Commissar General in Riga contains seven finding aids that describe the German records in Latvian. These handwritten and typed finding aids are available at the reading room.\r\n\r\nAt the State Archives of Latvia, EHRI has identified three important Holocaust-related fonds of Soviet origin, which contain material on war crimes investigations in Latvia. The identification and investigation work on these two fonds was carried out by local experts. Most of the work consisted of document analysis and research on previously undescribed archive fonds no. 1986. The work included reviewing the fonds card index (93,608 cards) and 26 record registration journals. As this fonds had no description, it was necessary to compare the data in the card index with the data in the registration journals to find certain criminal cases (persons convicted or judged). These criminal cases are usually several volumes long. To find all information about the Holocaust victims, one would have to examine all 52,653 records. The survey team looked through the criminal cases which consisted of a large number volumes, such as the files of Victor Arājs (1910-1988) and Boļeslavs Maikovskis (1904-1996). The former was the Chief of the Arājs Command who committed mass executions of Jews for the German Security Police. Arājs was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1979 by a Hamburg court. Boleslavs Maikovskis was a Latvian who served as chief of police for the second precinct of Rēzekne during the German occupation of Latvia in the Second World War. Maikovskis was tried under the German court system in 1988, but by 1994 was deemed too frail to continue the trial. Together, these cases are enclosed in dozens of volumes. Approximately 90% of the KGB documents are in Russian.\r\n\r\nEHRI has also added collection descriptions of sources held by the Latvia State Archive of Audiovisual Documents [Latvijas Valsts kinofotofonodokumentu arhivs].\r\n\r\nIn addition to the three archives named above, EHRI has identified four more institutions in Riga which hold Holocaust-relevant material on Latvia:\r\n\r\n- the Museum “Jews in Latvia” [Muzejs “Ebreji Latvijā],\r\n\r\n- the Museum of the Occupation of Latvia 1940-1991 [Latvijas Okupācijas muzejs],\r\n\r\n- the Riga Ghetto and Latvian Holocaust Museum [Rīga geto un Latvijas Holokausta muzejs].\r\n\r\n- National Archives of Latvia - State Archives of Personnel Documents [Latvijas Nacionālais arhīvs - Personāla dokumentu valsts arhīvs]\r\n\r\nThe repository descriptions for these institutions provide researchers with general information on the materials that can be found here.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Latvia, sources relevant to Holocaust research on Latvia can be found at Yad Vashem, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies and other locations.\r\n",

More Holocaust-relevant material on Moldova can also be found at Yad Vashem, which holds legal documentation from Moldovan KGB archives and, to a lesser extent, at the state archives of Odessa and Mykolaiv Oblasts in Odessa, Ukraine.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Moldova: Pre-existing research, available archival guides and expert support**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Moldova, EHRI could rely on a number of pre-existing works on the Holocaust in Romania, as well as a number of works specifically devoted to the Holocaust in Bessarabia and Transnistria. These works include the following monographs: Jean Ancel, *Documents Concerning the Fate of the Romanian Jewry during the Holocaust*, 12 vols. (New York: Beate Klarsfeld Foundation, 1986); Jean Ancel, *Transnistria, 1941-1942*, 3 vols. (Tel Aviv: The Goldstein-Goren Diaspora Research Center, 2003); Radu Ioanid, *The Holocaust in Romania: The Destruction of Jews and Gypsies Under the Antonescu Regime, 1940-1944* (Ivan R. Dee, 2008); Dennis Deletant, *Hitler's Forgotten Ally: Ion Antonescu and his Regime, Romania 1940-1944* (Springer, 2006); Diana Dumitru, *The State, Antisemitism, and Collaboration in the Holocaust: The Borderlands of Romania and the Soviet Union* (Cambridge University Press, 2016); Vladimir Solonari, *Purifying the Nation: Population Exchange and Ethnic Cleansing in Nazi-Allied Romania* (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009). EHRI has also relied on third parties that had previously carried out survey and copying work, such as the USHMM and Yad Vashem. \r\n\r\nEHRI did not identify finding aids specifically devoted to archival documents regarding wartime Bessarabia and Transnistria, but instead relied on available finding aids for different archives in Moldova. Four archival aids must be mentioned in particular: \r\n\r\n- *Tsentral'nyy Gosudarstvennyy Arkhiv Moldavskoy SSR i yego filial v g. Tiraspole, kratkiy spravochnik* [Central State Archive of the Moldavian SSR and its branch in Tiraspol, a brief finding aid] (Kishinev: \"Shtiintsa\", 1988)\r\n\r\n- *Îndrumătorul Arhivei Naţionale a Republicii Moldova (partea II-a, 1918 – începutul secolului XXI*, ediţia a II-a, revăzută şi completată) [The Guide of the National Archive of the Republic of Moldova (Part II, 1918 - beginning of XXI century, second edition, revised and supplemented)] (Chişinău, 2012)\r\n\r\n- *Arhiva Organizaţiilor Social-Politice a Republicii Moldova. Îndrumător* [Archives of the Social-Political Organizations of the Republic of Moldova. Finding aid] (Chişinău, 2008)\r\n\r\n- *Tsentral'nyy Gosudarstvennyy Arkhiv Pridnestrovskoy Moldavskoy Respubliki. Putevoditel’* [Central State Archive of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic. Finding aid] (Tiraspol', 2010)\r\n\r\nRelying on these finding aids, EHRI identified relevant archival fonds, compared archival holdings in Moldova with the archival holdings copied from Moldovan archives by the USHMM and Yad Vashem, and introduced both to the EHRI database.\r\n\r\nEHRI established contact with the director of the National Archives of the Republic of Moldova (NARM) in order to facilitate access to the Holocaust-relevant archival sources for EHRI Moldova country experts. Taking into account that a number of highly relevant documents are still stored at the Special State Repository of the Intelligence and Security Service (SIS), which regularly does not provide access to researchers, the full extent and importance of Holocaust-related documents held in Moldova is yet to be determined.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Moldova's archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nMoldova exhibits a highly centralized archival system and its administration, the State Archival Agency (Agenția Națională a Arhivelor) is in charge of the State archival system. The state archives are made up of two major archives in Chisinau and multiple regional and departmental archives. For a guide to the Moldova's archival system and its history see Mihai Taşcă et al., Ghidul arhivelor din Republica Moldova [Guidebook for the Archives in the Republic of Moldova] (Chișinău: Pontos, 2011). Prewar archival documents of Bessarabia and MASSR are stored in the NARM due to centralization effort during the 1950s. \r\n\r\nThe main challenge regarding research in Moldova's archives is the accessibility of data. Some documents of the archival fonds remain partially closed to the public. In NARM and the Archives of Socio-Political Organizations of the Republic of Moldova [AOSP, Arhiva Organizaţiilor Social-Politice ale Republicii Moldova] accessibility to inventories remains a challenge as the latter are only partially available in the reading rooms and must be requested separately. Access to thematic catalogues and the provision of advice and guidance to researchers are also often problematic. The archives in Moldova have only very recently started to digitise their collections.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Moldova**\r\n\r\n**C.I In Moldova**\r\n\r\nIn Moldova, EHRI has identified several archival institutions which hold or may hold Holocaust-relevant documents on Bessarabia and Transnistria. For these institutions, EHRI has made over 150 Holocaust-relevant archival descriptions available. In the NARM, EHRI identified documents on the prewar Jewish life and education, as well as wartime documents issued by the Romanian authorities related to administration of Bessarabia and Transnistria Governorate: directorates, town administrations [primaria], county administrations [prefectura] and district administrations [pretura], files of the gendarmery, corps of the Romanian army, police, tribunals, financial administration, chambers of commerce and industry, religious administration et altc. In the AOSP and Central State Archive of the (unrecognised) Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic [Tsentral'nyy Gosudarstvennyy Arkhiv Pridnestrovskoy Moldavskoy Respubliki], EHRI identified documents of the post-war Soviet authorities that mainly relate to the effort to assess the damage and human losses caused by the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n**C.II In other countries**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections outside of Moldova that are relevant to Holocaust research. Primarily, these are Holocaust-relevant collections at the USHMM, which has numerous microfilmed records from the NARM, as well as People’s Commissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVD) war crimes investigation and trial documents, and dozens of oral history interviews from Moldova. EHRI identified and introduced files to the database that are stored at the NARM, but are not mentioned in the NARM finding aid. Copies of these files, however, are available in the USHMM, including the files of the Republican Board of the Moldovan SSR to promote the activity of the emergency state commission for the investigation of crimes committed by German-Fascist invaders (1943-1947). In Israel, at Yad Vashem, EHRI identified war crimes investigation and trial records copied from the Special State Repository of the Intelligence and Security Service.\r\n\r\n",

Lamboo en H.A.J. van Schie, *Onderzoeksgids Joodse oorlogsgetroffenen; overzicht van archieven met gegevens over roof, recuperatie, rechtsherstel en schadevergoeding van vermogens van Joden in Nederland in de periode 1940-1987* (Den Haag: Algemeen Rijksarchief, 1998)\r\n\r\n- [1994] Erik Somers and Mark Pier, *Archievengids van de Tweede Wereldoorlogs. Nederland en Nederlands-Indië* (Zuthpen: Walburg Instituut, Rijksinstituut voor Oorlogsdocumentatie, 1994)\r\n\r\n- [1989] Atie van der Horst, Elly Koen, *Guide to the International Archives and Collections at the IISH* (Amsterdam: International Institute of Social History, 1989)\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Dutch archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAccording to the Dutch Public Records Act (1995), public archives are divided into State (Rijks), Communal (Gemeentelijke) and Regional (waterschaps) archival repositories. The National Archives [Nationaal Archief] are the central repository for archives transferred from national government bodies. The National Archivist is the head of the State Archive Service [Rijksarchiefdienst] and the Dutch National Archives. Besides the National Archives in The Hague, there are ten State Archives in the other provincial capitals, which were transformed (often after a merger with the city archives) into Regional Historical Centres [Regionaal Historische Centra] between 1998 and 2005. In addition to the state archives, there are collections in private archives and museums. A working knowledge of Dutch is necessary for any kind of archival research in the Netherlands, even though documents in other languages (German, English and French) can also be found with the help of the local archival staff.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on the Netherlands**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In the Netherlands**\r\n\r\nA considerable number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created in the Netherlands and can still be found in the country’s archives today. NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies holds important Holocaust collections. A joint effort of the National Archives and NIOD led to the creation of a website on Dutch WWII archival sources. A thematic query on “persecution of the Jews” leads to 773 archival collections in 142 archival institutions. These cover a broad variety of institutions, national as well as local and specialised institutions. There are also a number of private archives and documentation centres, such as the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam, which hold important Holocaust-related collections.\r\nEHRI identified over 160 repositories in the Netherlands and is able to provide thousands of descriptions of Holocaust-relevant archival units, most of which can be found at NIOD and at the Amsterdam City Archives.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections outside of the Netherlands that are relevant to Holocaust research on the Netherlands. In Germany and Israel, the Arolsen Archives and Yad Vashem hold significant documentation and a huge quantity of sources pertaining to Jewish individuals and/or groups during the Holocaust period.",

                "summary": "In Poland, EHRI has identified the SEZAM and Szukaj w Archiwach (Search in the Archives) databases as the most accessible archival research tools which are available online (http://baza.archiwa.gov.pl/sezam/sezam.php?l=en and http://szukajwarchiwach.pl/).

A full list is available in an extensive report.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Poland: Pre-existing research and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Poland, EHRI could rely on a vast amount of pre-existing research on the Holocaust. Research on this topic has been conducted for decades now by historians not only in Poland, Germany, the United States and Israel, but also in a number of other countries. Consequently, EHRI is unable to give a full and up-to-date account of the available literature here. However, it is important to highlight the 16 volume series *Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der europäischen Juden durch das nationalsozialistische Deutschland 1933-1945*, which is being published by EHRI-partner Institute for Contemporary History Munich-Berlin [Institut für Zeitgeschichte München-Berlin, IfZ] and Bundesarchiv, especially volumes 4 and 9, and 10. All volumes contain introductions based on international research literature and (as of 2024) are being translated into English (pmj-documents.org). Furthermore, the *Jewish History Quarterly* [*Kwartalnik Historii Żydów*], which is published by the Warsaw-based Emanuel Ringelblum Jewish Historical Institute [Żydowski Institut Historyczny im. Emanuela Ringelbluma, ŻIH] and the periodical “Zagłada Żydów” are probably the most reliable periodicals on current Holocaust research on Poland.\r\n\r\nEHRI has also relied on the following archival guides:\r\n- [1998-2011] Jóźwik, Marek (eds.), *Relacje z czasów zagłady - inwentarz / Holocaust survivors testimonies catalogue*, Archiwum ŻIH - INB, zespół 301 (Warsaw, Instytut Naukowo-Badawczy, 1998-2011)\r\n- [2009] Bednarek, Jerzy & Rafał Leśkiewicz (eds.), *Informator o zasobie archiwalnym Instytutu Pamięci Narodowej* (stan na dzień 31 grudnia 2008 roku) (Warszawa: IPN, 2009)\r\n- [2009] Shapiro, Robert Moses and Epsztein, Tadeusz, *The Warsaw Ghetto Oyneg Shabes-Ringelblum Archive, catalog and guide*, Bloomington, IN (Indiana Univ. Press) 2009 [Engl. version of 1st ed. 2011 Epsztein, Tadeusz]\r\n- [2007] Czajka, Michał, *Inwentarz zbioru pamiętników* (Archiwum ŻIH, zespół 302) – Memoirs Collection Catalogue (Jewish Historical Institute Archives, Record Group 302), Warszawa: Żydowski Instytut Historyczny, 2007\r\n- [2001] Woszczyński, Bolesław & Violetta Urbaniak (eds.), *Żródła archiwalne do dziejów Żydów w Polsce* (Warszawa, 2001)\r\n- [1998] Biernat, Andrzej (ed.), *Archiwa państwowe w Polsce.

Aufsätze und Berichte aus Lódź*, Jerusalem, Washington und Frankfurt am Main (Łódź, Muzeum Historii Miasta Lodzi, 1996)\r\n- [1972] *Druga wojna światowa 1939-1945. Informator o materiałach źródłowych przechowywanych w archiwach PRL* (Warszawa, 1972)\r\n\r\nWith EHRI’s help, the most comprehensive guide has been updated and translated from Polish into English: Alina Skibińska, *Guide to the Sources on the Holocaust in Occupied Poland* (Translated and expanded edition of the original *Polish Źródła do badań nad zagładą Żydów na okupowanych ziemiach polskich* by Alina Skibińska, Warsaw, 2007), European Holocaust Research Infrastructure, 2014, https://training.ehri-project.eu/sites/training/files/portal_assets/skibinska_guide.pdf.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Poland’s archival situation and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nUntil around 1990, the Polish state archival system imitated Soviet structures, which involved strong tendencies towards centralisation and almost complete inaccessibility. The network of Polish state archives opened up only after the crumbling of the Soviet bloc and the fall of communism in Poland. Since then, the network of state archives has functioned under the Head Office of State Archives [Naczelna Dyrekcja Archiwów Państwowych, NDAP].\r\n\r\nIn addition to the NDAP network, there is the Institute of National Remembrance [Instytut Pamięci Narodowej, IPN] which was created in 1998 as a successor organisation to the Main Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes [Główna Komisja Badania Zbrodni Hitlerowskich]. As the name suggests, it stores mainly documents on Nazi Crimes transferred from state archives, but also increasingly state security service files from the post-war period.\r\n\r\nOutside of the state archival and IPN networks, there is a wide range of archival institutions which hold Holocaust-relevant collections. There is, of course, the Jewish Historical Institute [Żydowski Instytut Historyczny, ŻIH] in Warsaw, which deserves a special mention as a key institution for Holocaust research on Poland and beyond, but also the network of church archives throughout Poland, and various archives of central administrative institutions, such as the Central Statistical Office [Główny Urząd Statystyczny, GUS]. The Archive of the Polish Red Cross also deserves to be mentioned. Finally, there are a number of state museums which were created in former German concentration camps (most importantly in Auschwitz, but also Majdanek) which hold, to a certain extent, archival material relevant for Holocaust research on Poland. A number of private institutions are also likely to hold Holocaust-relevant sources; important private research centres are “Karta” in Warsaw and Brama Grodzka in Lublin.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Poland**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Poland**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified over 100 archival institutions in Poland which hold or may hold Holocaust-relevant collections. At this point, it appears that a number of state archives which exist in all the major cities and in some regional centres throughout the country hold the most extensive Holocaust-relevant collections. The Central Archives of Modern Records [Archiwum Akt Nowych, AAN] in Warsaw and the local state archives hold essential collections concerning the German occupation in Poland, sources produced by the Polish resistance movement, but also documents created in the numerous ghettos in occupied Poland. In this regard, the State Archive in Łódź deserves a special mention, as it holds the archive of the Litzmannstadt ghetto. The Warsaw-based Jewish Historical Institute (ŻIH) stores the underground archive of the Warsaw ghetto (Ringelblum Archive), a key collection to Holocaust research in Poland. The ŻIH’s collections of testimonies and memoirs which were written and recorded after the war cover all of occupied Poland, including its former eastern territories (today Belarus, Lithuania and Ukraine), and even Germany, as former inmates of German camps and forced labourers in Germany left their testimonies at the Institute as well. In terms of the sheer quantity of sources, the collections described by EHRI in the state archives of Bydgoszcz, Lublin, Łódź, Poznań and Warsaw appear to be the most significant ones so far. Obviously, the somewhat smaller archival holdings identified elsewhere in Poland archives are not necessarily less important.\r\n\r\nThe collection descriptions in EHRI have been added from the archives’ databases (in Polish), combined with the English information in the Skibińska guide.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nAlina Skibińska’s *Guide to the Sources on the Holocaust in Occupied Poland* (Translated and expanded edition of the original Polish *Źródła do badań nad zagładą Żydów na okupowanych ziemiach polskich* by Alina Skibińska, Warsaw, 2007), European Holocaust Research Infrastructure, 2014, https://training.ehri-project.eu/sites/training/files/portal_assets/skibinska_guide.pdf includes information on sources on Poland held at repositories in Germany, Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States.",

EHRI has also relied on third parties that had previously carried out survey and copying work, such as the USHMM and Yad Vashem.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Romania's archival system**\r\n\r\nRomania has a centralized archival system with the National Archives of Romania [Arhivele Naţionale ale României, NAR] in charge of the State archival system. The state archives are made up of one major archive in Bucharest and multiple county branch archives. Several other state archives have their own archival system and collections. These include the Military National Archives of Romania, the Diplomatic Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Council for the Study of Securitate Archives.\r\n\r\nAccess to data in the NAR benefited from a protocol signed between NAR and the EHRI partner in Romania, the ‘Elie Wiesel’ National Institute for the Study of Holocaust in Romania. Access to data in the Military Archives was done via the Elie Wiesel Institute archival database.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Romania**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Romania**\r\n\r\nIn Romania, EHRI has identified several archival institutions which hold documents on Romania, Bessarabia, Bukovina and Transnistria. For these institutions, EHRI has made over 1,000 Holocaust-relevant archival descriptions available. In the NAR, EHRI identified documents on actions of the Jewish Central Office in Romania, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Work, Health and Social Protection, Presidency of the Council of Ministers. These collections cover administrative, political and judicial orders, decisions, reports, issued by Romanian authorities related to administration in Romania, Bessarabia, Bukovina and Transnistria. In the Military Archives, EHRI identified documents concerning military decisions mainly covering the Romanian governorates in Bessarabia, Bukovina Transnistria.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Romania, EHRI was able to identify vast Holocaust-relevant collections at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, which holds numerous selected records from various Romanian archives, institutions, organisations and individuals pertaining to the Holocaust period. They contain important source material produced by central government bodies, military and civilian authorities. Furthermore, Yad Vashem possesses important Holocaust-relevant material on Romania, such as the Wilhelm Filderman Archive: Chairman of the Federation of Jewish Communities in Romania, 1924-1947, and the Romanian Collection, which contains documentation on the history of Romanian Jews during the Holocaust period.

                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Serbia: Pre-existing research, third-party surveys and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Serbia, EHRI could rely on a number of pre-existing works on the Holocaust in Serbia. Some important websites that are also very useful for locating the historical sources include:\r\n- killingsites.org: a website about the killing sites around Belgrade where the Jews were shot in 1941. The website is the result of an international project and there are several archival documents available.\r\n- holokaust.arhiv-beograda.org: a website about the victims of the Sajmiste concentration camp with a list of victims and archival documents from the Historical Archive of Belgrade.\r\n- topovskesupe.rs: a website for the Mapping the Holocaust – The Topovske Šupe Camp project, which aims to present a digitized history of the Topovske Šupe camp to the public. It contains various archival material related to the camp and its victims.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Serbia’s archival situation and specific challenges**\r\nThe most relevant Holocaust repositories and collections in Serbia are:\r\n\r\n*The Serbian Military Archives* \r\n\r\n- *Collection of Microfilms relating to the German occupation from 1941 to 1945*\r\n\r\nThis fonds contains documentation concerning German military units and authorities in Yugoslavia. The material is arranged and processed following geographical and thematic sets. Many documents are copies from the Freiburg Military Archives.\r\n\r\n- *Serbian Government of Milan Nedic 1941-1945 fond*\r\n\r\nAccess to the military archive is very limited for non-Serbian citizens and they have to follow a particular procedure for obtaining the permission to conduct research in the Military Archives.\r\n\r\n*Archives of Yugoslavia*\r\n\r\n- *The State Commission for the Investigation of the Crimes of Occupiers and their Supporters fond*\r\n\r\nThe fonds contains strictly classified, original documents of the Nazi occupiers and their local fascist allies, as well as testimonies and inquiries conducted by Yugoslav authorities immediately after the war in order to record all the crimes committed against civilians in Yugoslavia and seek out and prosecute those responsible.\r\n\r\n- *The Royal Yugoslav Government-in-exile*\r\n\r\nDocuments on the Holocaust can also be found in this fonds. Many of these documents are reports which were sent from occupied Yugoslavia to the Royal Yugoslav Government in London.\r\n\r\n*The Historical Archives of Belgrade*\r\n\r\n- *Commander of Security Police and Security Services BdS/Befehlshaber der Sicherheitspolizei und des Sicherheitsdienstes fond*\r\n\r\nIn this fonds, there is a focus on Gestapo documents, particularly personal dossiers, and it is considered one of the few intact Gestapo document collections in all of Europe.\r\n\r\n- *Belgrade City Administration fond*\r\n\r\nDragi Jovanović, president of the Administration of the City of Belgrade, was one of the most reliable allies of the Nazi occupiers. The Special Police operated under his command, and in particular, the Police Department for Jews and Gypsies, which played an active role in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\n- *The Municipality of Belgrade fond*\r\n\r\nThe Municipality of Belgrade was in charge of administering the city. For this reason, this fonds contains materials concerning daily life in Belgrade during the Second World War.\r\n\r\n*The Jewish Historical Museum of Belgrade*\r\n\r\nEven though the Jewish Historical Museum does not have a particularly large collection dedicated to the Holocaust (the material mostly consists of copies from other archives), some interesting documents, such as the survivors’ testimonies, are very useful.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Serbia**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Serbia**\r\n\r\nEHRI identified several Holocaust repositories in Serbia and focused on four of the most relevant: the Archives of Yugoslavia, the Military Archive, the Historical Archive of Belgrade and the Jewish Historical Museum. \r\nDuring the research survey multiple fonds were selected and hundreds of documents were consulted and described. Approximately, these fonds represent more than 80% of the available documents in Serbia covering the Holocaust in German-occupied Serbia. They cover other topics as well, including the flight of Jews from Serbia and the Independent State of Croatia to the Italian controlled territories, the killing of the Jews from Bačka under Hungarian occupation in the Bor copper mines, and the crimes in the Independent State of Croatia.\r\n\r\nLocal archives preserve information about the small Jewish communities in other cities (Niš, Kragujevac, Sabac and others), while the Archives of Vojvodina preserve documents that are primarily concerned with the killing of the Jews from Novi Sad and the Bačka region under Hungarian, and later Nazi, control. Also located in Novi Sad, the Museum of Vojvodina’s Holocaust-relevant holdings have been described in the EHRI Portal.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nEven though a detailed survey of archives outside of Serbia has not yet been conducted, we note that documents related to the Holocaust in Serbia are preserved in German repositories, such as the Bundesarchiv and the Arolsen Archives. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has also collected many relevant documents, while the Russian State Military Archive should hold the records of the Serbian Jewish communities before and during WWII.",

As a result, EHRI has identified over 50 archives which either certainly hold Holocaust-relevant material or can be expected to do so. While the full list can also be found in the extensive report, at least five central institutions should be named here:\r\n- the State Archives of the Russian Federation (GARF) in Moscow, which include the files of the Extraordinary State Committee to Investigate German Fascist Crimes Committed on Soviet Territory, the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee files as well as the Nuremberg Collection;\r\n- the Russian State Archives of Socio-Political History (RGASPI) in Moscow, which hold the files of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the General Headquarters of the Partisans in the Soviet Union with reports on the occupied areas. Based on the results of a joint survey of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Yad Vashem, EHRI has integrated several collection descriptions from RGASPI;\r\n- the Central Archives of the Russian Defence Ministry (TsAMO) in Podolsk, which hold reports from Red Army records (Main Political Administration of the Red Army, GLAVPUR) resembling those of the Partisan’s General HQ in RGASPI and store “trophy” (captured) documents mostly of German provenance;\r\n- the Russian State Military Archives [Rossiiskii gosudarstvennyi voennyi arkhiv, RGVA], which house a large number of similarly captured collections not only of German provenance, but also many related to the Jewish communities in France, Belgium, Greece, Austria etc.; and\r\n- an extensive collection of interviews with local citizens and Red Army servicemen conducted right after the liberation of territories of the Soviet Union is held by the Scientific Archive of the Russian History Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences\r\n\r\nRegional archives hold local files generated by the abovementioned Extraordinary Commission, as well as material from local occupation administrations such as administrative files, lists of persecuted or displaced citizens, propaganda newspapers etc. Most documents related to Holocaust can be found in two types of collections: in the fonds of the local Extraordinary Commission and in the fonds of the Partisan movement. The Extraordinary Commission Fonds is usually held by the central State archive, while the documents about partisan movement can be found in the former party archive.

In Russia**\r\n\r\nImportant Holocaust-related collections at the State Archives of the Russian Federation (GARF) include the files of the Extraordinary State Committee to Investigate German Fascist Crimes Committed on Soviet Territory, the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee files as well as the Nuremberg Collection. The Russian State Archives of Socio-Political History (RGASPI) most importantly holds the files of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the General Headquarters of the Partisans in the Soviet Union, which contain reports on the occupied areas. Similar reports from the Red Army Main Political Directorate (GLAVPUR) records can be found at the Central Archive of the Russian Defence Ministry (TsAMO), which also houses captured “trophy” documents mostly of German provenance. The Russian State Military Archive (RGVA) houses a large number of similarly captured collections. Regional archives hold local files generated by the abovementioned Extraordinary Commission as well as material from local occupation administrations.\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified over 50 archival institutions which hold or are likely to hold Holocaust-relevant material in Russia. A dozen of them are concentrated in Moscow. Three more are located in cities near Moscow: Podolsk, Domodedovo and Krasnogorsk. A smaller cluster of relevant archival institutions is located in or near St. Petersburg. EHRI has also found that 14 other cities of the Russian Federation, mostly regional capitals or capitals of autonomous member-republics, have one State Archive and one Contemporary History Archive, which stems back to a former Communist Party Archive. EHRI has managed to provide collections descriptions for a number of these archives, which are located in Belgorod, Kaliningrad, Kaluga, Krasnodar, Kursk, Nalchik, Pskov, Rostov, Smolensk, Stavropol, Tula, Tver, Volgograd, Voronezh. EHRI has also identified and, in some cases, described collections in archival institutions in the following cities: Bryansk, Birobidzhan, Cherkessk, Elista, Maykop, Novgorod, Orel, Penza, Taganrog, Ust-Labinsk, Yeysk.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Russia, EHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections that are relevant to Holocaust research on Russia. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, for instance, holds selected records from a number of Russian Federation archives, both capital and regional. In Israel, Yad Vashem also holds significant documentation from archives in Russia and a huge quantity of sources pertaining to Jewish individuals and/or groups during the Holocaust period.\r\n",

A Swedish-language survey of Holocaust-related archives (see p. 243-276 in the following document: Sveriges museum om Förintelsen [https://www.regeringen.se/contentassets/03161ab08baa4461bb64b7ba1b25fd63/sveriges-museum-om-forintelsen-sou-202021.pdf]) has been integrated in Swedish and English into the EHRI Portal.  \r\n\r\nOutside of Sweden, EHRI has detected collections pertaining to Sweden and the Holocaust at the National Archives of Finland, at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Yad Vashem and Beit Terezin. EHRI has also discovered sources relevant to Sweden at the Hungarian National Archives and at the National Archives of Latvia.",

Documents of nationwide significance are stored in the Slovak National Archive. Documents of local importance are stored in the regional state archives. In late 2015 the system of state archives in Slovakia was reorganized. From 1 November 2015 there are 8 regional State archives (e.g. State archive in Bratislava) with 29 smaller branch archives operating now under the name “workplace Archive“ (e.g. State archive in Bratislava, workplace Archive Modra). There is one specialized state archive which operates under the name Spiš Archive in Levoča (formerly the State archive in Levoča). There are no specifically Jewish archival institutions in Slovakia with the exception of the Museum of Jewish Culture (a department of the Slovak National Museum) in Bratislava.",
                "summary": "EHRI was able to establish that documents concerning the Second World War and the Holocaust can be found in the Slovak National Archive, regional state archives, but also in the Military History Archive, Nationʼs Memory Institute Archive, Holocaust Documentation Center and in the Museum of the Slovak National Uprising in Banská Bystrica.\r\n\r\nHolocaust-relevant sources on Slovakia have been identified by EHRI in institutions outside of the country, such as Beit Theresienstadt or the Jewish Museum in Prague, but also the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, which holds selected records from the Slovak National Archive and regional state archives, Slovak armed forces as well as numerous oral history interviews. Furthermore, Yad Vashem possesses a number of collections which are relevant to Holocaust-research on Slovakia. The Political Archive of the German Foreign Office and the Bundesarchiv also hold Holocaust-relevant records on Slovakia, for instance on the SD Slowakei.\r\n",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Slovakia: Pre-existing research, available archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Slovakia, EHRI could rely on the general finding aids available at the archives in Slovakia itself. Third party surveys on Holocaust-relates sources, such as the ones carried out by USHMM, were very helpful as well.  \r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Slovakia's archival system** \r\n\r\nSlovakia exhibits a centralized archival system in which the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak republic is in charge of the State archival system. The state archives are made up of the Slovak National Archive [Slovenský národný archív] in Bratislava as well as several regional State archives [Štátny archív v Bratislave, Štátny archív v Košiciach, Štátny archív v Prešove etc.] seated in county cities with their multiple branch archives (Workplace Archive) seated in district towns. Several other state archives and institutions have their own archival system and collections such as the Military History Archives [Vojenský historický archív], the Slovak National Museum Archive [Archív Slovenského národného múzea] and Archive of the Museum of the Slovak National Uprising [Múzeum Slovenského národného povstania].\r\nIn terms of access to state archival system, EHRI benefited from the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Ministry of Interior and the EHRI partner in Slovakia, the Holocaust Documentation Center. \r\nThe access to other state-funded archives was organized individually. Besides the state-funded collection holding institutions, EHRI also identified and integrated into the EHRI portal data on collections of two NGOs: Nadácia Milana Šimečku [Milan Šimečka Foundation] and the Holocaust Documentation Center which is also the EHRI partner in Slovakia. \r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results in Slovakia**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Slovakia**\r\n\r\nIn Slovakia, EHRI has identified several archival institutions which hold documents on Slovakia and the territory that was annexed by Hungary for the 1938-1945 period. For these institutions, EHRI has made over 150 top-level relevant archival descriptions available. In the Slovak National Archive, EHRI identified important fonds for the study of Slovakia’s Holocaust history, including the holdings of the Ministry of Interior, Central Economic Office, the Office of the President of the Slovak Republic, the Bureau of the Prime Minister´s Office of the Slovak Republic etc. These archival fonds cover the most important political decisions, administrative orders and reports issued by the Slovak authorities towards Jews and Roma in Slovakia in 1938-1945. In various regional state archives in Slovakia EHRI identified important archival fonds of Slovak and Hungarian state administration bodies and security forces active in the territory of Slovakia (1938-1945) and in the territories annexed by Hungary. \r\nEHRI also identified a significant number of Holocaust-relevant archival fonds created by retribution courts after 1945 (National Court, District People´s Courts, People´s Courts) all over Slovakia.\r\nIn the Military History Archives EHRI identified documents concerning military decisions covering mainly military forced labour of Jews. \r\n\r\nC.II. In other countries\r\n\r\nEHRI identified Holocaust-relevant sources on Slovakia outside of the country in several institutions, such as Beit Theresienstadt or the Jewish Museum in Prague. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum holds selected records from the Slovak National Archive and regional state archives, Slovak armed forces as well as numerous oral history interviews. Yad Vashem possesses a number of collections that are relevant to Holocaust-research on Slovakia. The Political Archive of the German Foreign Office and the Bundesarchiv also hold Holocaust-relevant records on Slovakia, for instance on the SD Slowakei. ",

The name IW originates from the abbreviation of Idisher Visnshaftlejer Institut, which stands for the Jewish Institute of Investigation in Yiddish. \r\n\r\nThe IWO Foundation maintains a library, a historical archive and a museum, creating areas for study, inter-generational communication and the meeting of cultures. It was created in the year 1925 in Vilnius, the cultural center of the Jews of Central Europe. In 1928, its headquarters were established in Buenos Aires and it began to work independently from the Second World War onwards as the IWO of Vilnius was systematically looted and destroyed during the war years. IWO Foundation offers a wide range of cultural activities, including courses on Yiddish and Jewish culture, training workshops on cultural heritage topics, book and conference presentations, concerts, and much more.\r\n\r\nThe IWO Foundation has signed an agreement of cooperation with the Holocaust Museum in Buenos Aires. The purpose of this agreement is to foster activities of interest for the signatories, as well as for the general public, by strengthening the cooperative bonds and institutional coordination that contribute to the fulfilment of overlapping aspects of the statutory missions of both institutions. These aspects include: the preservation of documentation and the memory of the Shoah and the promotion of a culture of respect for Human Rights; non-discrimination; the prevention of persecution of minorities; and the fight against anti-Semitism, among others.\r\n\r\nThe IWO Foundation is also taking part in a program of microfilmation and digitisation with the United State Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Mémorial de la Shoah. The aim of this agreement is to describe, digitise and copy to microfilm materials from the IWO’s Historical Archive that refer to the Holocaust, resistance and cultural reconstruction, such as the archives of the Landslait Fareinen, the Comité Popular de Lucha Contra el Fascismo y el Antisemitismo, the archive of Shmerke Kaczerginski, and others. The program began to be formally implemented on July 2006."

In Buenos Aires there are around 165,000 Jews, and another 25,000, in 54 communities spread throughout the country. In 1862 the Israelite Congregation of Buenos Aires was born, the first institution of the Jewish community in Argentina. Among other things, it was devoted to charity and the registration of births, marriages and deaths of the community from 1879. That same year, the congregation began to raise funds to purchase of land with the aim of creating a cemetery that would allow Jews to be buried according to tradition. On 11 February 1894, the various Jewish societies of Buenos Aires met. They created the burial society Jevrá Kedushá, which would form the basis of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA). With successive immigration flows, AMIA broadened its activities and these now encompass aspects of social, cultural, educational, political, labor, socio-sports and religious life. \r\n\r\nThe AMIA’s Mark Turkow Documentation and Information Centre on Argentine Judaism (Centro Mark Turkow) was named after a Polish Jewish immigrant who arrived in Argentina in the 1930s after fleeing from Nazism. Mark Turkow dedicated his life to work to preserving the memory of Jewish culture in general and of the local community in particular."

                "extensive": "Disclaimer: The EHRI Extensive Report was updated in 2024.\r\n\r\n**A. EHRI approach to Austria: Pre-existing research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Austria, EHRI could rely on a number of pre-existing works on the Holocaust. Highly useful for EHRI’s identification efforts was a general overview of archives in Austria, Germany and Switzerland:\r\n\r\n[2009] *Archive in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz. Ein Adressenverzeichnis* (Münster: Ardey, 2009). Book + CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n[2023] *Archive in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz. Adressenverzeichnis 2023/2024* (Münster: Ardey, 2023). Book + CD-ROM\r\n\r\nThe publications of the Austrian Historians’ Commission [Österreichische Historikerkommission], which are available and searchable online at http://www.boehlau.at/histkom, are also helpful. Furthermore, the following platform is an important and specifically Holocaust-relevant online resource:\r\n\r\nNS-Quellen\r\nThis resource is dedicated to issues of expropriation between 1938 and 1945, and to issues of restitution and compensation after 1945. The platform itself is an entry point. Researchers will find detailed information about resources that can provide them with valuable assistance in their research (for example: In which Austrian archives can I find documents on expropriation? Where can I conduct research on citizenship revocation?; or how? How can I find out whether a specific property or rental was “aryanised”?). The platform offers an overview of the legal foundations of both the Nazi expropriation of property as well as restitution and compensation from the Republic of Austria after 1945. It gives direct access to the original texts of all the laws relevant to this context. There are also bibliographic references and explanations of individual terms. The information is in German. See here: (http://ns-quellen.at)\r\n\r\nInformation about further digital resources and services in Austria can be found on the website of EHRI Austria: https://www.ehri.at/en/projects/ \r\n\r\nAmong the more traditional research tools, the following guide is worth mentioning:\r\n[1995, 1991] Boberach, Heinz (Ed.), *Inventar archivalischer Quellen des NS-Staates. Die Überlieferung von Behörden und Einrichtungen des Reichs, der Länder und der NSDAP*, 2 Teile, (Munich: Saur, 1991, 1995). Also included in the commercial database “Deutsche Geschichte im 20. Jahrhundert Online: Nationalsozialismus, Holocaust, Widerstand und Exil 1933-1945”, http://db.saur.de/DGO.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Austrian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAustria exhibits a highly differentiated archival system without much centralisation. In addition to the Federal Archives and its departments (governed by the Bundesarchivgesetz), each of the Austrian Bundesländer has its own State Archive (each governed by the respective state Archivgesetz or statute). There are over 50 city archives. The religious communities in Austria, first and foremost bodies and organisations of the Catholic Church, exhibit a rich array of archival institutions. University archives, archives of noble houses (in particular the Liechtenstein archives) and a number of other, mostly topical archives as well as libraries holding archival material also exist.\r\n\r\nKey institutions identified by EHRI include the Austrian State Archive (Österreichisches Staatsarchiv/ Archiv der Republik), which has an online search engine (http://www.archivinformationssystem.at/suchinfo.aspx), and the respective state archives of the Austrian Bundesländer, which hold surviving files of central and regional administrative bodies as well as post-war investigations. Likewise important are the state operated Archive of the Mauthausen Memorial, which contains files of the Mauthausen concentration camp complex; the Dokumentationsarchiv des Österreichischen Widerstandes (DÖW), which contains material from private hands as well as serving as a hub for highly pertinent copied files accrued from dozens of archives; the Archive of the Jewish Community Vienna (Archiv der IKG Wien), which contains the files of the Vienna Jewish community encompassing the vast majority of Austrian Jews; the Vienna Wiesenthal Institute; for Holocaust Studies (VWI); and the Forschungsstelle Nachkriegsjustiz, which has collected the scattered information on post-war trials for Nazi war crimes.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Austria**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Austria**\r\n\r\nIn Austria, EHRI has identified over 200 state, municipal and church archives. While well over 25% of these archives are clustered in or around Vienna, there are also important archives in all Austrian Bundesländer.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Austria, material relevant to the Holocaust in Austria can be found in a number of institutions, including the German Bundesarchiv and the Arolsen Archives in Germany, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University, Yad Vashem, the Central Archive of the Jewish People in Jerusalem, the Wiener Holocaust Library in London, the Leo Baeck Institute in Jerusalem, New York/Berlin, and London, the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam as well as the National Archives of Hungary and the Hungarian Jewish Archives in Budapest, the Historical Jewish Institute in Warsaw, and the Jewish Museum in Prague.

Its task is to carry out comprehensive research into the history and culture of the Jews in Austria, from the Middle Ages up to the present day.  It is our aim to counteract anti- and philo-Semitic prejudices and incorrect information through academic research, publications, lectures and activities in the area of adult education and school projects. The location of the Institute in the former synagogue in St. Poelten gave a new and meaningful use to this abandoned building."

First chairman of the society was Erwin Chvojka, who at the time administrated Theodor Kramer's estate. Board members, among others, were Erich Fried, Bruno Kreisky und Hilde Spiel.\r\nThe aim of the Theodor Kramer Society is to increase the awareness and understanding of the literature and culture of persons in exile. To this end, the Theodor Kramer Society began publishing the quarterly journal Zwischenwelt in 1984, as well as a yearbook by the same name in 1990. Moreover, in 1995 the Society established a publishing house to give exiled Austrian authors a platform for their works to appear. The publications of the Theodor Kramer Society enable the tangible reception of the culture and literature of exile through concrete individuals, their experiences and their works. Every publication by the Theodor Kramer Society is another step in the fight against anti-Semitism, xenophobia, the denial of history and forgetting.\r\n"

The collection only includes items which have a connection to Tatura.

The collection and our reference library are a valuable source of research material for academics, school children, relatives and former residents.\r\n\r\nThe original four roomed building, c.1888, was the office building from which the irrigation scheme for the Western Goulburn Valley was developed. This became a private home and a doctor’s surgery for many years and was later occupied by the Reilly family who owned the Tatura Flour Mills. The building fell in to disrepair and was purchased by the Rodney Shire Council for the historical society and restored as a museum in 1988. This building now houses local history and the history of irrigation. Two brick extensions, totalling 200 sq. metres have since been added to house the Wartime Camps Collection, included is a foyer, shop, lecture room and art gallery complete with DVD viewing facilities."

The museum, initially run entirely by volunteers and survivors, aimed to collect and preserve Holocaust experiences and educate the community about the atrocities of discrimination. Survivors trusted the MHM with their personal collections and testimonies, contributing to the museum's unique living history. Over the years, the MHM expanded its facilities and professionalized its operations, receiving recognition and awards for its remarkable efforts. Today, the museum continues to educate and inspire, housing thousands of survivor testimonies and historical artifacts while serving as a vital resource for learning and remembrance."

Its purpose was to collect, preserve, and catalogue materials related to Jewish life in Australia, particularly in New South Wales. The project directors included Dr. Alan Crown, Dr. Neil Radford, and Jennifer Alison. The archive aimed to gather a wide range of materials reflecting Jewish life, including records, minute books, journals, newspapers, annual reports, newsletters, books, pamphlets, memorabilia, ephemera, cassette tapes, and photographs. The initiative was seen as vital for preserving the history of the Jewish community and shedding light on Australian attitudes towards minorities. The archive received donations of personal papers, including those of German Jewish refugees, and continued to expand its collection with magazines, minutes of organizations, photographs, and newspaper cuttings. Access to the archive was formalized, and efforts were made to copy early minute books onto microfiche for preservation. The project faced challenges in indexing and organizing materials due to the diverse nature of the collection, incorporating both archival and bibliographic materials. Despite these challenges, the archive aimed to combine the principles of both archivists and librarians to ensure the preservation and accessibility of its holdings.\r\n\r\nThere are currently 500 shelf metres of material, collected and processed over the thirty years of the Archive's existence."

Since 1938, the AJHS has provided a forum for the publication of scholarly accounts in its own journal, the Journal of the Australian Jewish Historical Society. Several meetings a year are presented for the delivery of talks and colloquia on historical matters. This website is intended to provide a speedy and accessible communication channel for our members, to give easy access to what the society is doing. Both the New South Wales and the Victorian chapters of the AJHS have been very concerned with the preservation of records, and have made representations to promote the preservation of our historic buildings and places.\r\n\r\nWithin the gamut of Australian Jewish history we include studies of Jewish activities in New Zealand and South East Asia, demographic studies, and accounts of passage to Australia. In addition, the Journal has published accounts of overseas occurrences, where there is a very strong linkage with Australian Jewish History.\r\n\r\nWe maintain close relationships with the Australian Jewish Genealogical Society. A remarkable percentage of the Australian Jewish community are either Holocaust survivors, or the children thereof. Historical studies, focussed on events of the Holocaust, as well as educational activities related to Holocaust studies, are primarily the gamut of the Holocaust Museums of Sydney and Melbourne. We have also forged beneficial ties with international bodies with similar interests to our own, learning from their experiences.\r\n\r\nThe Society is for all who share our interests. Membership includes a subscription to the Journal of the Australian Jewish Historical Society, which is published twice yearly. Members are also entitled to participate at reduced rates to the various tours of historical sites that have been organised by AJHS. These historically oriented tours have included walking tours of historical sites in the CBD and within various suburban centres such as Carlton, river cruises along the Maribyrnong River, bus trips to Ballarat, and long-weekend study tours of Tasmania.

Jewish Care continues to touch more than 6,000 lives each year, helping individuals and families in the Victorian Jewish community receive the support they need to meet their challenges.

Over the next 13 years at that location, the Jewish Museum of Australia presented over forty wide-ranging exhibitions, several of which travelled nationally. The Museum attracted significant communal support and won several prestigious industry awards.\r\nIn 1992 the Jewish Museum of Australia purchased a building in Alma Road, St Kilda opposite one of Melbourne’s most beautiful synagogues, the St Kilda Hebrew Congregation. On 20 August 1995, the then Governor General, Bill Hayden, officially opened the Jewish Museum of Australia, Gandel Centre of Judaica, named in honour of the Museum’s lead benefactors, John and Pauline Gandel."

This branch grew and eventually incorporated. There is no national executive, with the Sydney and Melbourne Societies being financially independent. Since 1988, the two Societies have shared the production of the Journal, with the June issues being produced by the NSW Society and the November issues being produced by the Vic Society.

Renamed the Archives of Bosnia-Herzegovina, they hold, conserve, process and enable the use of archives and current records of state bodies, state and public institutions as well as enterprises and corporate bodies, families and persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The main branch is in Sarajevo; there are also district (canton/county) archives located in several major administrative centers around the country: Sarajevo, Brčko, Bihać, Travnik, Tuzla, Goražde, Široki Brijeg and Mostar. The Archives of Bosnia-Herzegovina are not to be confused with the Archive of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina [Arhiv Federacije Bosne i Hercegovine], which was established in 1994 (also located in Sarajevo) and does not contain Holocaust-relevant collections. The Archive of Republika Srpska [Arhiv Republike Srpske] is another entity-level archival institution, located in Banja Luka (with several departments, located in Doboj, Foča, Trebinje and Zvornik). The country’s archival holdings have suffered, to a certain extent, from the war fought on its territory between 1991 and 1995, but also from recent events. For instance, the National and University Library, housed by Sarajevo's City Hall since 1949/50, was bombed and the resulting fire destroyed an estimated 80 percent of the Library’s collections. Meanwhile, the building has been restored and recently reopened. Furthermore, the National Archives of Bosnia were affected by riots; in 2014 collections of the so-called Depot 1, which contain, among other materials, sources on the investigation of war crimes committed on Bosnian territory during the Second World War, were partially damaged or destroyed.",
                "summary": "In Bosnia and Herzegovina, EHRI has identified a helpful guide which contains general information about Bosnian archives:\r\n\r\n- Bakaršić, Kemal, *Fragmenti kulturne historije Bosne i Hercegovine* (Sarajevo: Magistrat, 2005)\r\n\r\nSeveral archival institutions in the country have guides offering details about their collections but they are rarely available in English. More importantly, EHRI has identified several repositories relevant for Holocaust research, and described over 60 collections in this country. The Archives of Bosnia-Herzegovina can be considered the most important institution to hold Holocaust-relevant material in the country, as they have a vast collection from the Second World War period and from the Research Commission of Crimes Committed by Occupying Forces. Furthermore, the Jewish Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina [Muzej Jevreja Bosne i Hercegovine], which is a branch of the Museum of Sarajevo [Muzej Sarajevo], and the Historical Archives Sarajevo [Historijski arhiv Sarajevo] have documents concerning the Holocaust. Other archives and institutions in the country which are likely to be relevant for Holocaust research are the Jewish Community of Sarajevo, the Tuzla County Archives [Arhiv Tuzlanskog kantona] and Archives of Republika Srpska, among others.\r\n\r\nOutside of Bosnia and Herzegovina, certain Croatian archives, such as the Croatian State Archive in Zagreb and Osijek, may have further relevant material. In Serbia, the Jewish Historical Museum [Jevrejski istorijski muzej] in Belgrade holds significant amount of material pertaining to the Holocaust period in Bosnia. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) offers a number of relevant oral history interviews, and repositories in Germany and Italy are very likely to have collections pertaining to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\n",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Bosnia-Herzegovina: Pre-existing research, available archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nResearch conducted on the subject of the Holocaust in Bosnia and Herzegovina is still under development. In the last decade there has been some increase in research and interest in Holocaust-relevant sources, but mainly from outside the country (studies produced were either funded by the European Union or conducted by researchers from abroad). Sources that were particularly relevant to EHRI’s survey work include the following monographs: Anisa Hasanhnodžić, Rifet Rustemović, *After the traces of our neighbours: Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Holocaust* (Sarajevo: Institut za istoriju, 2015); Rusmir Agačević, *Snovopriče o Sefardima i Aškenazima travničkim* (Zagreb, 2013); Jakov Danon, Verica M. Stošić, *Memoari na holokaust Jevreja Bosanske krajine* (Banja Luka, Arhiv Republike Srpske, 2009); Aleksandar Gaon (ed.), *Mi smo preživeli…: Jevreji o holokaustu* (Beograd, 2001-2007); Avram Pinto, *Jevreji Sarajeva i Bosne i Hercegovine* (Sarajevo:Veselin Masleša, 1987); Jaša Romano, *Jevreji Jugoslavije 1941-1945. Žrtve genocida i učesnici Narodnooslobodilačkog rata* (Belgrade, Jevrejski istorijski muzej, 1980); Eli Tauber, *Kako se sporovodio holokaust u Bosni i Hercegovini* (Sarajevo, 2012), Eli Tauber, *When neighbours were real human beings* (Sarajevo, Jevrejska zajednica, 2010). EHRI also relied on dozens of written articles published in several journals (*Most, Baština sjeveroistočne Bosne, Jevrejski pregled, Jevrejski glas, Sefarad 92*, etc.), memoirs and previously conducted surveys and copies of relevant documentation performed by third parties, mainly by the USHMM, are also useful. EHRI has also identified a helpful guide which contains general information about Bosnian archives:\r\n\r\n- Bakaršić, Kemal, *Fragmenti kulturne historije Bosne i Hercegovine* (Sarajevo: Magistrat, 2005).\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s archival system**\r\n\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina has a heavily decentralized political structure that is reflected in its archival system as well. The central archival institution, the Archives of Bosnia-Herzegovina, is located in Sarajevo, the capital city. The majority of relevant records for Holocaust research are stored there, but the institution has no control over other archives in the country. There are two provincial (entity’s) archives, the “Archive of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina”, which does not hold Holocaust-related material, and “Archive of Republika Srpska,” which operate in their respective political entities, which were formed by the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995. Besides them, there is an archive in the District of Brčko. As with the Archive of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Brčko archives does not hold Holocaust-related material. The Archive of Republika Srpska has several branches, but it operates as a centralized institution, with headquarters in Banja Luka. Moreover, the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, besides having its archival institution, also has cantonal (county) archives. These archives operate in most of the cantons (Travnik, Široki Brijeg, Bihać, Mostar, Tuzla, Goražde, Sarajevo). However, these institutions are independent and work under their own, cantonal laws. This heavily decentralized archival system can sometimes be a hindrance to efficient research. It is also worth noting that most of the archives are still in development, which can further delay research and availability of records.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Bosnia and Herzegovina**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Bosnia and Herzegovina**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified a number of archival institutions and other types of organisations which hold Holocaust-relevant documents and has described over 60 collections. The Archives of Bosnia-Herzegovina are the most important institution in possession of Holocaust-relevant material as they hold a vast collection from the Second World War period and from the Research Commission of Crimes Committed by Occupying Forces. Furthermore, the Jewish Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina [Muzej Jevreja Bosne i Hercegovine], which is a branch of the Museum of Sarajevo [Muzej Sarajevo], the Historical Archives Sarajevo [Historijski arhiv Sarajevo] and the archives of Jewish communities (Sarajevo, Doboj, Mostar and others) have documents that are relevant for Holocaust research. The collections and fonds of these institutions cover a broad range of documentation, but they mostly contain administrative, political and judicial documentation created by authorities (local or higher levels), organizations, military structures, etc.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Bosnia and Herzegovina, EHRI was able to identify a significant number of Holocaust-related collections at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, which holds selected records from several Bosnian archives (Travnik, Tuzla, Sarajevo), individuals and communities. Relevant material can also be found in other former Yugoslav countries, namely, Serbia and Croatia. The Jewish Museum in Belgrade (Serbia) and the Croatian State Archives (in Zagreb) contain numerous collections related to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Jews and the Holocaust.",

They made an immeasurable contribution to the development of economy, culture, health, trade and craft activities. The first doctor from Doboj was Simon Levi; Dr Rihard Skuteski founded the first choral society in Doboj in 1927, and his wife was the first nurse from Doboj. The first veterinarian mentioned in Doboj’s history was Leopold Kalc in 1920, while the brothers Pesah were Doboj traders who opened a department store. Jews were the owners of the first Doboj’s bank and printing press, which was led by Moric Trinki and the first lawyer in the city was Emil Rubinstein.\r\n\r\nNowdays, the Jewish Community in Doboj is small in number when compared to other religious communities, and part of its membership is made up of citizens of Jewish origin living in Teslic, Samac and Derventa. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, Jewish Community actively works to preserve the identity, religion, culture and traditions of its people, as well as developing good neighbourly relations with other peoples. In addition to preserving Jewish values, the Jewish community in Doboj aims to promote and maintain peace as well as cultural and economic cooperation among all the peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of the Jewish contribution to a better life for the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish Municipality in Doboj strives to foster Jewish tradition and culture, but also to preserve monuments of Jewish culture and traces of life of Jews who are no longer in Doboj and the areas of nearby towns in the Republic of Srpska and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Community feels it has an obligation to support, as best it can, communities in the municipalities of Bijeljina, Brcko, Bosanski Brod, Vlasenica and Zvornik and the surrounding areas in cooperation with the Federation of Jewish Communities of Bosnia and Herzegovina."

                        "history": "The Archives of the City of Banja Luka were established by the Decision of the People's Committee of the City of Banja Luka, number 4735 dated 20 April, 1953.\r\n\r\nAccording to the approval of the Executive Council of the National Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 1719-14 dated 30 May, 1956, the Archives of the City of Banja Luka became County Archives, authorized for the areas of the municipalities of Banja Luka and Prijedor. The establisher's rights were taken over by the People's Committee of the County Banja Luka (Decision no. 2170 dated 29 June, 1956) with the consent of the People's Committee of the County Prijedor (Decision no. 1291 dated 15 February, 1956).\r\n \r\nDuring 1958, in the Local Community Office Nova Topola, an archival warehouse was established, in which the records collected on the territory of the County Bosanska Gradiska were deposited. Gradually, it became the Archival Collecting Center Bosanska Gradiska.\r\n \r\nIn a few years the Archives was developed into a respective institution whose depots had 250 archive groups and 9 archival collections of great importance for studying of social, political, economic, cultural and other conditions in the territory of northwest Bosnia.\r\n \r\nThe professional analysis of the collected records from the period 1878-1918, 1919-1941 and 1941-1945 was initiated. The majority of the records written in Turkish, German and Serbian language was stored in the building where the Archives had been placed - \"Banska uprava Vrbaske Banovine\" (i.e. the People's Committee of Banja Luka County). Unclassified records were taken over in the state they were found, without record on takeover. An Organized take over of the records started in 1961.\r\n \r\nThe development of the archival service, a great inflow of documentation and increasing awareness of the need to perform of archival activity throughout the whole territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1963 resulted in the establishment of the regional institution called the Archives of Bosanska Krajina with Head Office in Banja Luka.\r\n \r\nThe territorial and actual jurisdiction of the Bosnian Krajina archive covered the regions of Banjaluka and Bihać.\r\n \r\nThe Archives of Bosanska Krajina was still growing and new collective centers were formed in Prijedor (1 April, 1963), Jajce (1 February, 1964) and Bihac (15 April, 1964).\r\n \r\nThe collective centers accepted a great number of archive groups of the abolished county, municipality and community People's Committees.\r\n\r\nOn 1 January 1967, the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina took over from the counties the establisher's rights and financing of the activities of the Archives of Bosanska Krajina.\r\n \r\nThe great earthquake that struck Banja Luka on 27 October 1969 impeded the development of the archival service. Only by the middle of 1973 was a partial solution for the problem of record storage was found. The Archives together with the Museum of Bosanska Krajina were moved to the partly rebuilt \"Carska kuca\".\r\n \r\nAs of 1 January, 1974, after constitutional and territorial changes, responsibility for financing the Archives was taken over by 23 municipalities (Banja Luka, Bihac, Bosanska Dubica, Bosanska Gradiska, Bosansko Grahovo, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi, Bosanski Petrovac, Cazin, Celinac, Drvar, Jajce, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Laktasi, Mrkonjic Grad, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Sanski Most, Skender Vakuf, Srbac, Sipovo and Velika Kladusa). These municipalities took over the establisher's rights from the Republic in 1976.\r\n \r\nIn 1981, the Archival Collecting Center in Bihac was abolished. The Historical Archives Bihac took over the responsibility for the protection of the records on the territories of the municipalities Bihac, Bosansko Grahovo, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Petrovac, Cazin and Velika Kladusa.\r\n\r\nDuring 1983 the Archival Collecting Centers in Prijedor and Jajce were abolished.\r\n \r\nThe armed conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1992-1995) had numerous negative consequences for archival activity. Until the middle of 1993 on the territory of the Republic of Srpska, the Archives of Bosanska Krajina with Head Office in Banja Luka, Regional Archives in Doboj and Regional Archives in Srbinje/Foca were active.\r\n \r\nBy the Act on Ministries (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Srpska\" no. 19/93), the Archives of the Republic of Srpska with Head Office in Banja Luka was established and had a status of an independent republic administrative organization.\r\n \r\nIt is consisted of the Archives of Bosanska Krajina in Banja Luka, Regional Archives Office in Doboj (established on 16 February 1954) and Regional Archives in Srbinje/Foca (established on 1 January 1976).\r\n \r\nBy the Article 40 of the Act on Ministries (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Srpska\" no. 19/93) the legal status of the Archives was changed again. Today it is a republic administrative organisation within the Ministry of Education and Culture, with real and territorial authority over the whole territory of the Republic of Srpska."

                        "history": "The establishment of the Archives of Tuzla Canton and the establishment of archival activities in the wider Tuzla area was carried out only after the Second World War. The Canton Archives were founded by the City People's Committee in Tuzla on 1 July 1954, in accordance with the recommendation of the Executive Council of the People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (NR BiH) No. 3768/53 of 24 January 1954. \r\n\r\nThe Archives of Tuzla Canton were founded as the Archives of Tuzla town, and started to supervise the region of northeast Bosnia which, since 1962 , includes 19 municipalities. Regional Archive jurisdiction was in force until 1992, when it stopped due to war circumstances, and the jurisdiction officially ceased to exist in 1995. The territorial jurisdiction of the present-day Archives of Tuzla Canton is related to the development of archival service in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was repeatedly adapted to the political-administrative organization of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Notably, in 1968, the Archives of Tuzla town's collection centre became part of the former Archives in Doboj. This integration came about mainly due to political reasons. Consequently, the Archives of Tuzla's area of jurisdiction was expanded to a total of 28 municipalities: Banovići, Bijeljina, Bosanski Samac, Bosanski Brod, Bratunac, Brčko, Derventa, Doboj, Gracanica, Gradacac,Kalesija, Kladanj, Lopare, Lukavac, Maglaj, Modrica, Odžak, Orašje, Srebrenica, Srebrenik,Sekovici, Teslic, Tesanj, Tuzla, Ugljevik, Vlasenica, Zvornik and Zivinice. This integration did not achieve the expected results and, as early at 1973, the single institution disintegrated into two: the Archives of Tuzla and Archives in Doboj. \r\n\r\nFrom then until 1992, the Archives of Tuzla had jurisdiction over 19 municipalities of northeast Bosnia: Banovici, Bijeljina, Bratunac, Brčko, Gracanica,Gradacac, Kalesija, Kladanj, Lopare, Lukavac, Orašje, Srebrenica Srebrenik, Sekovici, Tuzla, Ugljevik, Vlasenica, Zvornik and Zivinice. From 1977 to 1994, Archives of Tuzla has existed as \"Regional Historical Archive Tuzla\". Due to wartime circumstances and the establishment of the District Tuzla, the Archive was renamed the Historical Archive of Tuzla Canton, and therefore had authority over the creators and holders of current records in this area, which was under the control of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the war and after the signing of the Dayton Agreement in the Archive had jurisdiction over the creators and holders in the area of 13 municipalities of Tuzla Canton, which until 1999 belonged to the part of the municipality of Brčko, which significantly reduced the territorial jurisdiction of the Archives. For the development and operation of the Archives of Tuzla in the period after the war, i.e., after the signing of the Dayton Agreement, it was essential to adopt the Law on Archives of Tuzla Canton in 2000. According to the provisions of this Act, the Archive in 2002 re-registered as the Archives of Tuzla Canton, the name under which it operates today. Specific organisational changes through which the Archive went were the result of wider social trends, especially changes of a territorial-administrative nature. "

The institution includes the National Archives in Brussels, which holds the records of the various national/federal Ministries (including the Foreigner Police), and 17 State Archives, which are distributed throughout the country. In 2016, the Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary (CEGESOMA), was integrated into the State Archives. Founded in 1969, this federal research and documentation centre holds important Holocaust-related collections. The Directorate-General for War Victims, another important organisation, is part of the Federal Public Service for Social Security. In 2018, the Archives and Documentation section of the Directorate-General for War Victims was also integrated into the State Archives. In addition to these official archives, there are also collections in private archives and museums including, Kazerne Dossin: Memorial, Museum and Research Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights, which is located in the buildings of the former transit camp Dossin in Mechelen, the Jewish Museum of Belgium, the Auschwitz Foundation, and the Foundation of Contemporary Memory.\r\n",
                "summary": "EHRI has identified a number of helpful publications and archival guides on Belgium (see the extensive report). At the same time as EHRI had started its identification and investigation work, the National Archives of Belgium commenced a project which aimed to produce a guide to sources on Jewish life in Belgium. EHRI closely cooperated with this project’s directors and researchers. The identification of repositories holding Holocaust-related collections dramatically improved thanks to this collaborative identification work. \r\n\r\nOne of the most important Belgian archives for Holocaust research is Kazerne Dossin: Memorial, Museum and Research Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights. This museum and research centre actively collects material, often private collections, about the Holocaust in Belgium. It holds the largest collection of materials on the topic in Belgium, including original, photocopied and scanned materials. EHRI supported Kazerne Dossin by helping them transfer the existing texts into archival descriptions according to international archival standards and integrating new descriptions into this system. This resulted in a major step forward for Kazerne Dossin: from 17 collection descriptions, Kazerne Dossin now provides EHRI with hundreds of descriptions. It is continuing this effort in order to make all its materials publicly available on a collection level.\r\n\r\nMade up of the National Archives, 17 State Archives in the Provinces, the Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (CEGESOMA); and the Directorate-General for War Victims, the State Archives are another significant institution that hold Holocaust-related material. In particular, the National Archives branch in Brussels conserve the archive of the former Military Justice system, which includes all the post-war trial records. Some important city (and communal) archives also have Holocaust-related material, such as those of Brussels, Antwerp, Liège, Charleroi and Ghent. Moreover, EHRI has worked closely CEGESOMA. Collection descriptions from the Centre were selected via key-word selection and literature search (verification of bibliographies of key works on the Holocaust in Belgium) and integrated onto the Portal by EHRI. This export includes archival documents, manuscripts, interview descriptions, and photo descriptions. As for the Directorate-General for War Victims, it possesses one of the largest and most important collections on the Holocaust in Belgium from the victims’ perspective.\r\n\r\nThere are also several important private archival institutions in Belgium. Notably, the Jewish Museum of Belgium in Brussels, which holds important sources related to the victims, as do some remembrance organisations, such as the Auschwitz Foundation and the Foundation of Contemporary Memory, which collect testimonies.\r\n\r\nMany other sources are stored in repositories outside of Belgium. First of all, there are the archives of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (with branches in New York and Jerusalem) and the World Jewish Congress records on Belgium (stored at the Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati). The Yad Vashem archives hold both original and copied materials on Jews in Belgium, including the original documents of the Belgian Jewish Committee in London during the Second World War. Likewise, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum holds vast materials on Jews in Belgium, both originals and copies. Their copy collection on Belgium includes copies from Kazerne Dossin, the Directorate-General for War Victims, CEGESOMA, and the National Archives (Foreigners’ Police archives, Brüsseler Treuhandgesellschaft collection, Archive of the Diamond collection and other files). The USHMM’s original collections include the “Fela and Chaïm Perelman papers”. The extensive report on Belgium also includes references to publications on sources on Belgium stored in German and French archives (most notably, the German sources on Belgium kept at the French National Archives at Pierrefitte-sur-Seine, the sub-series AJ40, and those kept at the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv Freiburg).",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Belgium: Pre-existing research and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nTwo official research projects, commissioned by the Belgian State, that have been carried out by CEGESOMA and others, have mapped a significant proportion of Holocaust-related archives in Belgium. The first project, conducted in 2001, was about the spoliation of Jewish assets during the war. The second, the results of which were published in 2007, investigated the possible responsibility of Belgian national and local authorities in the persecution of the Jews. The major publications resulting from these projects were:\r\n\r\n- *Les biens des victims des persécutions anti-juives en Belgique: spoliation, rétablissement des droits, résultats de la Commission d’étude. / De bezittingen van de slachtoffers van de jodenvervolging in België: spoliatie, rechtsherstel, bevindingen van de studiecommissie: eindverslag*, Brussels: Chancellery of the Prime Minister, July 2001\r\n\r\n- Rudi Van Doorslaer (dir), Emmanuel Debruyne, Frank Seberechts, Nico Wouters (a.l.p.d. Lieven Saerens), *La Belgique docile. Les autorités belges et la persécution des juifs en Belgique durant la Seconde guerre mondiale*, Brussel, Luc Pire/Ceges, 2007, 2 vol., 1,545 p. / Rudi Van Doorslaer (red.), Emmanuel Debruyne, Frank Seberechts, Nico Wouters (i.s.m. Lieven Saerens), *Gewillig België. Overheid en Jodenvervolging tijdens de Tweede Wereldoorlog*, Antwerpen/Brussel, Meulenhoff-Manteau/Soma, 2007, 1,163 p.\r\n\r\nAt the same time as EHRI had started its identification and investigation work, the National Archives of Belgium commenced a project which aimed to produce a guide to sources on Jewish life in Belgium. EHRI closely cooperated with the directors of the project at the National Archives and the two project researchers, Gertjan Desmet and Pascale Falek Alhadeff. The major publication resulting from this project was:\r\n\r\n- Pierre-Alain Tallier (dir.), Gertjan Desmet & Pascale Falek-Alhadeff, *Sources pour l'histoire des populations juives et du judaïsme en Belgique/Bronnen voor de geschiedenis van de Joden en het Jodendom in België, 19de-21ste eeuw*, Brussel, ARA-AGR/Avant-Propos, 2016, 1,328 p.\r\n\r\nBefore the publication of this guide, no such archival overview existed, although there were other synopses available that dealt with periodicals and publications on Jewish history (and in the case of the latter, indirectly shed light on certain primary sources, although its main focus was on secondary sources):\r\n\r\n- Zosa Szajkowski. “Bibliography of Jewish Periodicals in Belgium, 1841–1959”, *Studies in Bibliography and Booklore*, Vol. 4, No. 3 (June 1960), pp. 103-122 (Published by: Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion; Article Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/27943319).\r\n\r\n- Daniel Dratwa. *Répertoire des périodiques juifs parus en Belgique de 1841 à 1986*, Brussels: Pro Museo Judaico, 1987.\r\n\r\n- Barbara Dickschen — Jacques Déom — Catherine Massange — Jean-Philippe Schreiber, *Guide Bibliographique: Les Juifs en Belgique*, Brussels, Fondation de la Mémoire Contemporaine-Stichting Eigentijdse Herinnering, 2008 [updated version in 2014].\r\n\r\nIn addition to the works mentioned above, EHRI’s identification work relied on many other publications on the Holocaust in Belgium as well as other archival guides (none of which were entirely dedicated to Holocaust sources). For a general introduction to sources on Belgian contemporary history, see:\r\n\r\n- Patricia Van den Eeckhout & Guy Vanthemsche (eds.), *Bronnen voor de studie van het hedendaagse België, 19e-21e eeuw* (Brussels: Koninklijke Commissie voor Geschiedenis / Commission royale d'Histoire, 2017, 3rd revised edition).\r\n\r\nFor finding aids on sources on Belgium during the Second World War in German and French archives, see:\r\n\r\n- Stefan Martens & Sebastian Remus, *Frankreich und Belgien unter deutscher Besatzung 1940-1944; die Bestände des Bundesarchiv-Militärarchivs Freiburg* (Stuttgart: Jan Thorbecke Verlag, 2002).\r\n\r\n- Guy Beaujouan, Anne-Marie Bourgoin, Pierre Cézard, et.al., *La France et la Belgique sous l'occupation allemande, 1940-1944. Les fonds allemands conservés au Centre historique des Archives nationales. Inventaire de la sous-série AJ40* (Paris: Centre historique des Archives nationales, 2002).\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Belgian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nBelgium has a large number of repositories, considering the size of the country, and they are a mixture of public and private initiatives. This means researchers can sometimes find them hard to navigate. When looking for basic information about victims, local and national administrations are often in possession of personal files. The majority of Jews in Belgium were not Belgian nationals (less than 10 percent at the registration in 1940). For the non-naturalized legal residents the Belgian Foreigners’ Police kept personal or family files. These files are held in both local level institutions (the city administrations) and in the National Archives (central files). It is important to note that the Jewish communities in Belgium were concentrated in Brussels and Antwerp, and to a far lesser extent in Charleroi and Liège. Following the decree from 29 August 1942, Jews were only allowed to live in one of these four cities. But still there are interesting sources in other city archives. The case of the deportation of a few thousand Jews from Antwerp to communities in the adjacent province of Limburg at the end of 1940 illustrates this. They were allowed to return after a few months, but their stay obviously left traces in some of the local archives. These archives can be identified using (local) studies on this very specific subject, but these are very small archives with sometimes very limited collections on the Holocaust period. The foreigners’ files are accessible via name registers, organised according to date of arrival in Belgium. It should be noted that public administrations in Belgium were (and are still) not allowed to register ethnic or religious background. None of the official pre- or post-war sources therefore mention “Jew” or “Jewishness” (unlike in the neighbouring Netherlands, for example, where religion was duly registered).\r\n\r\nIndeed, this access via names – instead of, for example, by topic – poses one of the most important challenges to locating both victim and perpetrator sources in Belgium. Important victim sources are held by the Directorate-General War for Victims, a state institution, originally founded by the Ministry of Reconstruction and now part of the State Archives. Its task was to gather information on war victims in different military archives, judicial archives, etc., in order to obtain settlement and/or victim recognition. It thus built up a huge collection of personal files and files on some organisations, such as the Jewish resistance. There is no online catalogue, only a card index system which is not publicly accessible. It is alphabetically ordered, so one has to know the name of the person whose files he or she is looking for and there are no specific references to the persecution of the Jews. There is also an inventory, but using it does not resolve the issues mentioned above.\r\n\r\nSimilar problems arise in the case of one the most important archives for the study of the perpetrators. The archives of the former Military Justice system, which hold the files of the post-war trials of war criminals and collaborators, have been transferred to the National Archives but are not publicly accessible, consultation requiring the authorisation of the *Collège des procureurs généraux/College van procureurs-generaal*. Access is generally granted for researchers, the individuals concerned and their descendants. A research guide and summary finding aid exist.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Belgium**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Belgium**\r\n\r\nEHRI's identification and investigation work in Belgium was based on a three-pronged approach:\r\n\r\n1. Actively identifying repositories (and collections, in the case of CEGESOMA) via the bibliographies of key publications on the subject.\r\n\r\n2. Providing Kazerne Dossin – Memorial, Museum and Documentation Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights with know-how and assistance to provide shareable descriptions of its sources that meet international archival standards.\r\n\r\n3. Working closely together with the authors and directors of the research guide on *Sources pour l'histoire des populations juives et du judaïsme en Belgique/Bronnen voor de geschiedenis van de Joden en het Jodendom in België, 19de-21ste eeuw*\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the identification of repositories holding Holocaust-related collections was dramatically improved by EHRI’s identification work, both via its own identification work based on the abovementioned reference works and through cooperation with the National Archives and their research guide authors. At the start of EHRI, the Directory of Holocaust-Related Archives of the Claims Conference listed 7 Belgian archives while the *Guide éuropeen des sources d’archives de la Shoah* provided information on 9 repositories. EHRI's portal now contains information on over 120 repositories, most of them with detailed information.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the huge gap that had to be covered has much to do with the belated interest in Holocaust documentation and research in Belgium. CEGESOMA was created in the late 1960s, which is rather late compared to similar institutions in other countries, such as NIOD in the Netherlands. Moreover, although the persecution of Jews during the Second World War was always present both in the collections and in research, it was never a central focus point. This delayed interest was very much visible when EHRI started its activities. EHRI's activities coincided with the beginnings of a research guide to Jewish sources at the National Archives, and the opening of Kazerne Dossin, so the project started precisely at a time when the topic was finally receiving wide attention in Belgium from academic, archival and public perspectives.\r\n\r\n**_Identification of collections_**\r\n\r\n*Kazerne Dossin*\r\n\r\nDue to the aforementioned challenges, the first point of call of any research on the persecution of Jews in Belgium should be Kazerne Dossin. Kazerne Dossin was originally established in the mid-1990s as the Jewish Museum of Deportation and Resistance and was located in the former transit camp Dossin in Mechelen. This museum and research centre actively collects material, often private collections, related to the Holocaust in Belgium. It holds the largest collection of materials on the topic in Belgium, including original, photocopied and scanned materials. Often, Kazerne Dossin can offer easier access to originals kept elsewhere, as it has, first of all, such a wide variety of sources in one central place and, secondly, because its database can trace multiple sources on one person, thereby giving easy access to scanned foreigners’ files on victims of the Holocaust (whereas in the original archives one would have to go through the register and then request the file needed, or search for the correct microfilm) or other sources. Consulting these sources in the original repository, would require considerable effort in terms of administration and identification. Moreover, Kazerne Dossin keeps track of ongoing research and employs a team of experts in the field.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite the wealth of its sources, the archives of Kazerne Dossin remained relatively unknown to the outside world until 2015 because of the limited information available via finding aids. On its website, Kazerne Dossin originally only provided one text describing its main collections, which was regularly updated: The number of described collections fluctuated between 9 and 17 and the identifier numbers attached to the collection descriptions changed. Many of the materials – often precious private sources from victims or survivors, donated to the museum – remained hidden behind generic descriptions such as “Museum’s collection” or were only described in a separate Word document, stored in a folder together with the scans of the originals and only accessible to staff. EHRI supported Kazerne Dossin by helping them transfer the existing texts into archival descriptions according to international archival standards, and integrate new descriptions into this system. This resulted in a major step forward for Kazerne Dossin: the number of collection descriptions provided to EHRI rose from 17 to over 220 descriptions and Kazerne Dossin is continuing its efforts to make all its materials publicly available on a collection level. As one of the archivists stated: “It is only since EHRI came along that people here accepted the need to work according to international archival standards”.\r\n\r\n*CEGESOMA*\r\n\r\nThe Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (CEGESOMA) also holds important Holocaust collections, such as as the archives of the Devisenschutzkommando, the records of the trial against von Falkenhausen, the Tätigkeitsberichte of the Military Administration and important files from the former Military Prosecutor's Office. Collection descriptions from CEGESOMA were selected via keyword selection and literature search (verification of bibliographies of key works on the Holocaust in Belgium) and integrated by EHRI's IT specialists. The export includes archival documents, manuscripts, interview descriptions, and photo descriptions.\r\n\r\n*Sources pour l'histoire des populations juives et du judaïsme en Belgique/Bronnen voor de geschiedenis van de Joden en het Jodendom in België, 19de-21ste eeuw*\r\n\r\nThis archival guide was analysed and the descriptions relevant to the EHRI project, both in Belgium and abroad, were selected and added to the EHRI portal.\r\n\r\n**C.II.In other countries**\r\n\r\nMany sources are stored in repositories outside of Belgium. First of all, there are the archives of the JDC (with branches in New York and Jerusalem) and of the World Jewish Congress records on Belgium (stored at the Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati). Original documents of the Belgian Jewish Committee in London during the Second World War are available at Yad Vashem (M.22). This committee, founded in 1943 in London by Herman Schamisso, unified a group of Belgian Jewish exiles in London. Their records contain correspondence with various Jewish institutions in Belgium, England, the US and elsewhere. They also contain correspondence with the Belgian government-in-exile about ways of assisting Jews in Belgium and Jews from Belgium in exile abroad. Furthermore, the records include lists of deportees and survivors. In addition to this rich collection, Yad Vashem has both original and copied documents on Jews in Belgium, including on Jewish resistance (M.64, 0.29, 0.44). There are also indirect sources on Jews in Belgium, such as “Documentation regarding the Holocaust from the Central Archives in Moscow, 1939-1945” (M.40) and “Documentation of the Central British Fund” (M.56).\r\n\r\nUSHMM also holds vast materials, both originals and copies, on Jews in Belgium. Their copy collection on Belgium includes copies from Kazerne Dossin, the Directorate-General War for Victims, CEGESOMA, and the National Archives (Foreigners’ Police, *Brüsseler Treuhandgesellschaft* collection, Archive of the Diamond collection and other files). A non-exhaustive list of the copies includes: selected records from the Belgian War Crimes Tribunals and Investigation Records, selected records from the Ministry of Reconstruction of Belgium, selected records from the Belgian Royal Archives, selected records related to the Pierre Beeckmans Anti-Jewish organisation in Belgium, selected records from the City of Liège and from the *Consistoire Central Israélite de Belgique*, and records relating to the Breendonk camp. The original collections include the “Fela and Chaïm Perelman papers” (Acc.nr. 2006.432). Chaïm Perelman (a very influential philosopher in the fields of the philosophy of law and argumentation) founded the \"*Comité de Défense des Juifs*\", the Jewish underground in Belgium. Both Chaïm and Fela worked for the underground during the war. Fela opened a kindergarten called \"Nos Petits\" in 1942 and when the school closed she made efforts to hide Jewish children.\r\n\r\nGerman sources on Belgium during the Second World War are stored at, among other places, the French National Archives at Pierrefitte-sur-Seine (sub-series AJ40), and the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv Freiburg.\r\n\r\n",

It was not until the end of the Ancien Régime that it became an independent municipality.\r\n\r\nIn 1795, Anderlecht became the principal town of a canton. This canton had 11,400 inhabitants and 11 municipalities: Anderlecht, Dilbeek, Groot-Bijgaarden, Itterbeek, Jette, Laaken, Sint-Agatha-Berchem, Sint-Jans-Molenbeek, Sint-Maartens-Bodegem, Vlezenbeek and Wambeek. The canton had extensive pastures, which made it known for its rich grain production.\r\n\r\nIn 1890, it became the seat of a peace court. Due to language laws, the Dutch-speaking municipalities were removed from the canton in 1963. This meant that only the municipalities of Anderlecht and Sint-Agatha-Berchem belonged to the canton."

                        "history": "Shortly after the Second World War, Ghent University started collecting its archives. Until 1947 , the oldest archival documents were kept in crates in the then rectorate building in Voldersstraat. After the tenure of Rector E. Blancquaert, these crates were transferred to the University Library, preserving valuable and unique pieces such as the student registers and record books.\r\n\r\nIn 1954, the chief librarian KG Van Acker took the initiative to make the archive more accessible to the public. This was undertaken by students in 1955. Prof. J. Dhondt appointed the archives’ first staff member in 1964 and the rectorate correspondence was opened to public consultation. \r\n\r\nAt this time, increasing bureaucratisation meant that the university administration was confronted with a growing mountain of paperwork. This led to the establishment of the University Archives in 1972 as a 'central' service under the supervision of Prof. K. De Clerck.

                        "history": "The sporadic presence of Jews has been reported in Ghent since the Middle Ages.  However, not much is known on the subject, other than the fact that the Jews were expelled from the town, and indeed from all of Flanders, in 1125.  Jews were apparently admitted again in the 13th century but driven out once more during the 1348-49 outbreak of the Black Death.  They did not show up again in Ghent until the 18th century, although not until the late 18th century, with the French occupation, could one truly speak of a Jewish community taking root in the town.  A score of Jewish families were living in Ghent in 1817, and they already had a synagogue.\r\n\r\nThis small community was given a plot of land for a cemetery in 1847.  While the Jewish community of Ghent was recognized officiously by the young Belgian State’s authorities in 1834, official recognition did not come about until 1876.  It was granted by the Royal Decree of February 7, 1876, as was the case for the main Jewish communities of Antwerp and Brussels and the smaller communities of Liège and Arlon.\r\n\r\nIn the first decades of the 20th century the city attracted a certain number of Jewish students from Central and Eastern Europe.  They enrolled in Ghent University, and more particularly in its Polytechnical School.  An estimated 300 Jews were thus living in Ghent on the eve of World War II.\r\n\r\nDuring the German Occupation of 1940-45 Jews were allowed to live in only four cities, namely, Brussels, Antwerp, Charleroi, and Liège.  Those who refused to submit to the Nazis’ diktat had no other choice than to go into hiding.  Upon the country’s liberation, Ghent’s Jewish community reassembled.  Its members included several dozen engineers - former students of Ghent University from the interwar period - who held leading positions in Ghent’s industries, some doctors, and several university professors.  What is more, the community was enriched by the arrival of Israeli students who became integrated in Jewish community with amazing ease.  It also hosted a number of Israeli professors on sabbatical who contributed to its cultural activities.  Then a wave of Jews from the former Soviet Union swelled the community’s ranks.\r\n\r\nThe Six Day War in the Middle East and the febrile days of the summer of 1967 mobilized the city’s Jews and sympathizers.  The result was a surge of activity around the Bloch Center.\r\n\r\nReligious services were held for some twenty years in a synagogue that was renovated along the lines of Djerba’s synagogue in a strong collective movement.  However, in 1995 this building was no longer available.  Since then, the community has been given access to a room in a Protestant center where it holds religious services and various celebrations.  At Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights, children and adults come together there in a festive mood marked by music and the distribution of presents.  The Passover seder (ritual Jewish Easter meal) is a great success each year, as are other holiday celebrations, such as Tu bi’shevat and Purim.\r\n\r\nHug Ivry Gent (the Hebrew Studies Circle) has brought Jews, Protestants, and Catholics together for Bible and Hebrew classes for more than thirty years.  Other activities, such as talks on cultural subjects and current events, are likewise organized around these weekly evening classes.  In addition, the community is asked to help fellow Jews, be they Belgian or foreign (often Israelis), hospitalized in the area and to look after patients awaiting organ transplants.\r\n\r\nFinally, the community takes pride in having erected the Michael Lustic Memorial with the help of many donors, the bishopric, and public authorities.  It is an original monument in the form of a top on which the names of Ghent’s Holocaust victims are engraved.  The commemoration of the terrible events of Kristallnacht is held in front of this memorial each year with the help of the city and patriotic organizations’ participation.  In parallel, a delegation of the Jewish community of Ghent attends the annual May 8th celebrations.\r\n\r\nIn short, this community is characterized by its openness and constructive dialogue with fellow citizens of all backgrounds."

On 1 December 1845, the Academy was reorganized by King Leopold I, who clearly divided the Science Faculty from the Literature Faculty and added the Fine Arts Faculty.

As the “brains” of the Jewish community, he immediately took things in hand and founded the Jewish Primary School, which the Dutch government honored with the title of “model school.” The capital of Brabant already had two Jewish cemeteries at the time.\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of Belgium’s independence (in 1830), the community’s headquarters were established in a rented house. In 1834, the Chief Rabbi Elie Carmoly inaugurated a synagogue in Rue de Bavière (today’s Rue de Dinant). The building became the Maison du Peuple (”House of the People”) in 1886.  Some forty-four years later, in 1878, Chief Rabbi Aristide Elie Astruc consecrated the new Main Synagogue of Brussels, in Rue de Régence, just two years after the Jewish Community of Brussels’s official recognition (Royal Decree of February 7, 1876). The Jewish Community of Brussels recently celebrated the 125th anniversary of the superb synagogue’s founding.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish Community of Brussels’s history, central location, and involvement within the broader Belgian Jewish community since its official recognition have contributed greatly to the fact that so many leading figures - leaders in our country’s Jewish community and in Belgian society in general - are to be found among its members past and present."

France’s annexation of the episcopal principality then ensured the Jews’ presence and civil and political equality. The number of Jewish families living in Liège is thus rose from eight in 1808 to 220 in 1890. Most of these families originally came from Dutch Limburg (50%), Prussia, and Alsace-Lorraine. During this period the Jewish community answered to the Jewish community of Maastricht, which itself belonged to the Consistory of Krefeld.\r\n\r\nFormal recognition of the Jewish Community of Liège came about in 1876 with the Royal Decree of 7 February. In 1878, the community set up its headquarters in the Outre-Meuse neighborhood, where the abandoned chapel of the former Saint Julian’s Hospice, which had been turned into a grain market at the time of the French Revolution, became a synagogue. \r\nThe number families making up the community doubled in the early 20th century, especially after World War I, due to the incessant influx of immigrants fleeing the poverty and pogroms of Eastern Europe. \r\n\r\nOnly half of the community survived the Holocaust and the synagogue was profaned. A double painting of the victims’ names in Latin and Hebrew letters that hangs at the back of the synagogue recalls the memory of some of them, along with the resistance fighters and Jewish soldiers who fought against Nazi Germany. Moreover, many ornaments, stained-glass windows, and ritual objects are dedicated to them.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish community of Liège participated and continues to participate in many patriotic events and inaugurations, including the inauguration of the American cemetery and the national memorial to the Resistance. The synagogue and the Jewish Center next it continue their activities and house a range of very active institutions, such as WIZO, S.O.S.-Bienfaisance, the S. Kruglanski Museum, KKL, and the Hachomer Hatsair Youth Movement. Today, services continue to be held for shabbat and there are also weekly Jewish studies classes. "

The institute was concerned with political, economic and social training, studies and research on the history of the workers' movement. Its main objectives were to organise conferences on the history of the workers' movement and to publish books, brochures and theoretical journals (e. g. the Cahiers marxistes from 1969 onwards).\r\n\r\nIn 1971, the Jacquemotte Foundation extended its activities to the creation and custody of an archive and library. Consequently, the PCB entrusted its archives to the FJJ. The classification of the PCB archives was begun as well as the cataloguing of the library, which was enriched by the collection of the Bibliothèque populaire, which had ceased its activities.\r\n\r\nIn the 1980s, after having been one of the main sources of the Foundation's publications, the archives also began to serve as basic materials for historical exhibitions. Nevertheless, the archive remained relatively inaccessible to researchers as only certain fonds were accessible and consultations had to be arranged by appointment.\r\n\r\nFrom 1985 to 1986, under the scientific direction of José Gotovitch (Université Libre de Bruxelles) and Juul Verhelst (Archives générales du Royaume), three collections were sorted for the first time: the archives of the national congresses of the PCB-KPB (1919-1982); the library's books and brochures published in Belgium; and the directory of communist newspapers and magazines. The archives branch of the FJJ also took the opportunity to make the collections more accessible to students and researchers. \r\n\r\nAs of 1992, public access to the archives has been reassured. Moreover, a policy aiming at the preservation of fonds of organisations or private individuals has been put in place, which allowed the Centre to significantly increase its collections.\r\n\r\nIn 1994, the Council of the French Community adopted the proposal for a decree recognising private archival centres in the French Community of Belgium. It is within the framework of this new legislation that the FJJJ and its Centre des archives communistes en Belgique (CArCoB) submitted an application for recognition to the Community Government in May 1995. The recognition and grant agreement entered into force in 1996 and was renewable every three years. Since then, the archives – previously kept in the building where the central authorities of the former PCB-KPB, \"18-20, avenue de Stalingrad\" in Brussels, were located – have been housed in the former Maison de la Presse Communiste, at 33 rue de la Caserne, still in Brussels, where the editorial, administrative and printing staff of the daily Le Drapeau Rouge were located.\r\n\r\nOn 1 January 2001, CArCoB became an independent non-profit organisation. And since 1 January 2006, it has been contractually bound with the French Community of Belgium Wallonia-Brussels by a five-year agreement.\r\n\r\nCArCoB works in consultation and collaboration with its Flemish counterpart, Documentatie en Archief van de Communistische Beweging (DACOB).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Also the first religious ceremonies took place: weddings, circumcisions, bar- and bat mitzvot. The growing community moved to new premises in 1976 and acquired a warehouse located on the Avenue Kersbeek. The synagogue was inaugurated in 1979. At the same time a training school of Judaism (Talmud Torah) was set up, hosting dozens of children and adults. \r\n\r\nBeth Hillel initially had a strained relationship with and was not recognised by consistorial religious authorities. One of the main objects of controversy being the non-recognition of the Jewishness of some members of Beth Hillel, resulting in the refusal to bury certain Beth Hillel members in the plots of the two Jewish cemeteries. The CA of Beth Hillel therefore acquired a concession in the cemetery of Kraainem, Gan Hashalom, for an independent plot to bury its members. Today, the Liberal Jewish Community of Belgium is represented in a large number of Jewish institutions in the country."

This institute, the first of its kind in Belgium, aimed to collect the historical materials necessary for the study of social history. An enormous amount of prospecting work was undertaken at institutions and with personalities likely to deposit their archives there before the German occupiers interrupted the Institute’s activities in 1941.\r\n\r\nThe Emile Vandervelde Institute (EVI), which succeeded the INHS, officially opened on 29 September 1947 in the same premises. However, its ambitions were broader than those of its predecessor, since its aims were to \"create, promote, develop and coordinate at a national level, activities relating to the study of economic, social and cultural issues as well as all initiatives aimed at increasing workers' knowledge and organising their leisure activities, all the while being a non-profit organisation”.\r\n\r\nFrom 1948 onwards, the Institute operated as a centre for the study of the Parti socialiste belge (PSB, later the PS), with the objective of conducting research on all economic, social, financial, administrative, political, ethical and legal issues facing the Party and its organisations.\r\n\r\nApart from this political component to its operations, the library and archives continued their historical work. Gifts, deposits and acquisitions, obtained over the course of nearly three quarters of a century, have ended up creating a particularly rich and varied documentary body of social and labour history.\r\n"

                        "history": "Jesode Hatora - Beth Jacob was the first Jewish school to be founded in Antwerp. There is no certainty about the exact date of the foundation, because all documentation was lost during the war years. It is known that around 1885 a kind of cheder (religion class) existed, where Jewish boys received religious education.\r\n\r\nAround 1894, at the initiative of Hersch Krengel (a textile trader from Austria), a day school for boys was founded, where, in addition to general education, a full Jewish program was offered.\r\n\r\nIn 1920, this school was officially recognised by the Ministry of Education. The girls 'school was founded later, in 1936, and received official recognition in 1937. This is how the original structure of the school was created: Jesode-Hatora was exclusively for boys and Beth-Jacob was exclusively for girls.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the 1930s, many German Jews had fled to Belgium. Their children were taken care of in Jesode-Hatora, which accommodated a total of 936 students. In May 1940, many refugees left for the United States, the United Kingdom or France, so the school closed its doors for a few weeks. Shortly thereafter the lessons resumed for around 500 students.\r\n\r\nFrom December 1940 onwards, Jewish children were forbidden from attending mainstream schools so the number of pupils at Jesode-Hatora greatly increased. Meanwhile, non-Jewish teachers were also banned from teaching in Jewish schools. The teachers in question were given six months to leave the institution where they were employed.\r\n\r\nThe teachers of the Jesode-Hatora eventually remained in the school until 1942 roundup. At the time the order to commence the roundup was issued, no fewer than 500 students were confined in the school. However, by the time the raid was actually carried out, the building was completely empty. The then principal, together with his teachers, had brought the students to safety by guiding them home.\r\n\r\nThe school building itself could not be saved and was looted by the occupiers and demolished from the inside. The principal's exceptional courage is still praised to this day. He was decorated for his bravery with a medal of honor from the Holocaust Museum Yad Vashem in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the Second World War, an Auschwitz survivor, Mr. Klagsbald started rebuilding the school. His reasoning was that the Holocaust survivors had a duty to breathe new life into the Jewish community.\r\nWith that ambition he gathered the remaining youngsters and Jesode-Hatora reopened in August 1945 with 17 students. Other key figures who also played a crucial role in the reconstruction of the school were Messrs Ringer, Rottenberg, Freilich, Perl, and Chief Rabbi Kreiswirth. Thanks to the efforts of these prominent men, the influx of Jewish students increased over time. \r\n\r\nJewish community life gradually returned to Antwerp and over the years other Jewish schools were reopened or founded.\r\n\r\nIn 1958, the secondary education establishments (the atheneum and the middle school) were recognised by the then Ministry of National Education and Culture. In the following years, a wing was added to Lange van Ruusboecstraat and Steenbokstraat. The school’s successful expansion continued even further with the establishment of a teacher training college which was recognised by the Ministry of National Education in 1965.\r\n\r\nToday, Jesode-Hatora Beth-Jacob has around 758 pupils, making it the largest recognised Jewish school in Flanders."

In 1878, the premises were moved to rue Bara 47. In 1900, with the financial support of Mr. Franz Philippson, the organisation could buy the land on rue de Glacière where new buildings were built and opened 12 May 1901. The institution was a legally recognised association as February 8 1923 under the name of \"retirement home for elderly Jews.\" The number of residents increased. Its purpose was \"to host and take care of Jewish elderly of both sexes of at least sixty years old who are unable to meet their needs themselves.\" It also housed people paying for these services. According to Maxime Steinberg, as the retirement home of rue de Glacière was open during the occupation, staff depended on the AJB. After the war, the home was chaired by Mr. and Mrs. Paul Philippson. At this time the home had about thirty residents but was in bad shape and had to be renovated and expanded. This was done thanks to the financial support of the JDC and the JCA, Mr. Simon and Ms. Lina Haim, Leon Maiersdorf but also the subsidies from the Jewish Material Claims Against Germany inc., the COREF and the Gustav Furweiler Foundation inc. In 1949, the home had doubled its capacity. The subsidies from JOINT reduce in 1950 to stop in June 1951. The Home is affiliated with the Central Jewish charities. In 1959 the works for the construction of a new building on rue de Glacière start, this is where the institution is now. The old building was converted into a clinic. The nursing home took the name of Heureux Séjour on May 28, 1961."

The curator considered since its creation that a section on folklore and Jewish history should be an integral part of the future museum, but no trace of this section was found in the documents relating to the first exhibition of the institution. It was about to open a section related to the Hebrew archeology and Jewish folklore to enrich visitors' knowledge of Judaism and in particular to help them discover the history of Jewish communities established in Anderlecht. But despite numerous contacts with various museums and Jewish personalities, financial resources remained limited, as the available space. This project did not come into existence. The project was to be completely stopped during and after the war. However, a showcase devoted to Judaism was exhibited at the Museum up to 1954. The museum still has to this day a \"Jewish collection\" including hundreds of archives dating mainly from the inter-war documents, but also Judaica, objects of worship and prayer books."

                        "history": "At the end of the 18th century, Ghent was under French rule. The French confiscated important art treasures, which can now be seen in the Louvre, among other places. In 1798, it was decided to assemble a public collection in Ghent. This then still modest collection was for a short time housed in the St. Peter's Church, until in 1809 it was provisionally accommodated in a room of the Municipal Academy.\r\n\r\nOver the years, the basic collection changed only slightly. In 1837, the city council purchased a painting by a contemporary artist for the first time, which came from the Ghent Triennial Salon. Since then, the city continued to purchase works at salons, hence the museum's very extensive collection of 19th-century art. In 1860, the museum bought its first work by an old master.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the end of the 19th century that the collection of ancient art was greatly expanded. This was due to the foundation of the association 'The Friends of the Museum'. Fernand Scribe, chairman of the Friends of the Museum, donated his entire collection to the city in 1913. Other important donors were Georges Hulin de Loo, Tony Simon-Wolfskehl, widow Lasnitzki and Raoul De Keyser.\r\n\r\nThe spectacular growth of the collection, thanks to numerous purchases and donations, meant that a new location was soon required. In 1820, Tieleman Franciscus Suys drew up the first plan for a new museum building. It was not until 1898 that the final design and location were determined.\r\n\r\nThe collection, supplemented with loans, is opened each year through temporary exhibitions. In January 2018, the museum was discredited for exhibiting 24 loans from the Toporovski Collection whose authenticity was disputed by experts. After criticism in the press, the museum management removed the artworks, whether real or alleged, and called for research by art experts. In March 2018, director Cathérine de Zegher was dismissed from her position by the city, on suspicions of forgery surrounding the loan, because she could not provide proof that she had conducted research on the collection prior to the loan, and after it turned out that she had made false statements at the city's culture committee.\r\n\r\nIn January 2020, the exhibition 'Van Eyck, an optical revolution' started. There, 13 original works by Jan van Eyck were brought together, along with another 9 works from his studio. Due to the corona crisis, the exhibition had to be stopped prematurely. Nevertheless, 'Van Eyck, an optical revolution' did win the international Apollo Award for 'Exhibition of the year'."

The museum, owned by the city of Brussels since 1811, was ceded to the newly created Belgian state according to the agreement of 31 December 1842. In 1907 the first ‘society of friends’ was created: les Amis des Musées royaux de l’État à Bruxelles, counting among its members many dignitaries and personalities of the Jewish financial and industrial elite, including baron Léon Cassel, Léon Lambert, Franz Philippson and Jules Philippson. In 1919, after the First World War, the Museum was directed by chief curator Hippolyte Fierens-Gevaert. Today, the collections of the MRBAB include over 20000 works of art. Today, the MRBAB comprises the Old Masters Museum, the Modern Museum, the Wiertz Museum, Meunier Museum, Magritte Museum and the Fin-de-Siècle Museum. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/the-institution/historical-background\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed history (until 2002), see Van Kalck, Michèle (ed.), *Les Musées royaux des Beaux-Arts de Belgique : Deux siècles d’histoire*, 2 vols., Brussels, Éditions Racine, 2003."

The Royal Museum of Armed Forces and Military History was born.\r\n\r\nAfter the First World War the ensemble grew through gifts and donations by foreign governments. Leconte could also take his pick from equipment left behind by the Germans. The collections were bursting at the seams and a move to larger premises became imperative. In 1923, the Museum took possession of the north wing of the Jubilee palaces. Louis Leconte, who had left active military service, was appointed curator in chief.\r\nDuring the Second World War, the Germans occupied the Museum and the institution only reopened after the conflict. The Museum then diversified and created new departments: military history, archives and library, print room and map room. In that way, the institution’s scientific character was emphasised and concepts such as conservation, restoration and presentation become key factors.\r\n\r\nThrough the Royal Decree of June 11,1976, it became a category two federal scientific institution with three departments: Technology, Scientific Documentation and Research. Its general mission was to research, obtain, preserve, and place documents, studies, publications or objects concerning military history at the disposal of the public.\r\n\r\nNew sections are established: in 1972 the Air and Space section saw the light of day and the armoured vehicle section was opened in 1980. Six years later, the Museum welcomed the magnificent arms and armour collection, which had formerly been on display at the Hal Gate Museum. In 1996, the Navy also found safe harbour at the Museum. All forces are thus represented in the KLM-MRA’s collections. In 2004, the European Forum of Contemporary Conflicts was inaugurated in the Bordiau Hall presenting an overview of twentieth century conflicts after 1918.\r\n\r\nThe Museum not only manages the site in the Jubilee Park, but also several external museums (Trench of Death, Mount Kemmel, Bastogne Barraks, Gunfire Brasschaat) and remote storage facilities."

                        "name": "Tachkemoni School",
                        "history": "The Tachkemoni school was founded in 1920 and ‘recognised’ (aangenomen) by the city of Antwerp the following year. Among the founders – primarily Mizrachi (religious Zionist) Jews – were rabbi M.A. Amiel of the Shomre Hadas community and E. Karlin. Chief Rabbi Ernest Wiener became one of its spiritual leaders. \r\n\r\nThe choice for education in modern Hebrew was daring but ultimately proved successful. In religious terms, Tachkemoni was (and is) less orthodox than the Jesode-Hatora-Beth-Jacob (JHBJ) school. The primary school was complemented by a kindergarten in 1926 and a section for girls in 1937. From 1927 the school organised evening classes of Dutch, French and English to stimulate the integration of the parents of the many foreign students. Before the Second World War the Tachkemoni school had about 675 pupils. \r\n\r\nDuring the Occupation, the school was taken over by the Vereniging der Joden in België – Association des Juifs en Belgique and was called Joodse school van Antwerpen until its closure in 1943. The buildings were then used as a school for the Duits-Vlaamse Arbeidsgemeenschap, a collaborationist organisation supported by the SS. After the short-lived experiment as a unified Jewish school in Antwerp (with JHBJ)(5-25 October 1944), the Tachkemoni school resumed classes in early May 1945 as a separate institution, with 61 pupils. The infrastructure, damaged by bombings, was restored with funding from the Verenigde Israëlitische Gemeenten (and its hevra kadisha) and funds collected by Antwerp Jews exiled in New York. The lack of teachers for Jewish courses (and Hebrew) was solved by recruitment in Israel, which, however, often resulted in practical problems. The decision to organise mixed classes also dates from the immediate post-war period; initially a pragmatic choice due to the lack of students, the system remains in place in the present. \r\n\r\nThe further expansion of the school was made possible by the financial support of the Shomre Hadas community and the Claims Conference. An athenaeum (high school) was created in 1949 and subsidised by the State from 1959. A new kindergarten opened in 1957; the school has had its own synagogue since 1966. \r\n\r\nToday, the Tachkemoni school offers pre-primary, primary and secondary education. Both secular and Jewish subjects are taught. The Hebrew courses in particular are meant to provide the pupils with the necessary preparation to study at Israeli universities. At present, the Tachkemoni school has about 570 pupils."

                        "history": "The MADOC-CEDOM is Research and Documentation Centre founded in 1969 by the Grand Orient of Belgium. The Grand Orient of Belgium (GOB) was created in 1833 as an umbrella organisation of Freemasonry in Belgium. The GOB is a federation for so-called “Symbolic” Freemasonry only and not of “Scottish” Freemasonry, which has 33 instead of 3 degrees, and which has been governed by the Supreme Council (Suprême Conseil, Opperraad) since 1817. Although many Belgian Freemasons were Catholics, Liberalism became predominant after the episcopal condemnation of Freemasonry (1837). The Belgian lodges played a key role in secular, anticlerical ‘Latin’ Freemasonry. The issue of allowing political discussion within the lodges, as well as the irreligious or more deistic nature of the rituals formed points of conflict. By the end of the 19th century, notably as a result of modifications in suffrage and the advent of new political ideologies, political discussion was increasingly less accepted. In 1959 the Grand Lodge of Belgium (Grande Loge de Belgique, Grootloge van België), loyal to the requirements and rituals of the United Grand Lodge of England and recognised by it between 1965-1976, seceded from the GOB. In turn, the Grand Lodge faced a split of ‘regular’ lodges in 1979. The Supreme Council (Opperraad) too was split up in several smaller federations. Since 1989 a “friendship agreement” (vriendschapsconventie) exists between the obediences of the various Symbolic lodges, in which their disagreements are recognised and accepted. Relevant for this guide is the persecution of Freemasonry by the occupier during the Second World War, because of the alleged ties between Judaism, Freemasonry and Bolshevism. To “prove” this link, the archives of the GOB were confiscated; eventually they ended up, like so many other archives, in Moscow. Several German and collaborationist organisations (including REX and the Antimaçonnieke Bond l’Épuration – De Bezem) occupied the premises of the GOB in Lakensestraat in Brussels."

The law stipulated that the archives of institutions and administrations abolished by the French authorities were to be collected and preserved at the regional metropolis of each newly created ‘Département’. In 1831, the archive depot in Brussels was officially named the “Archives Générales du Royaume” (National Archives of Belgium). By virtue of the Royal Decree of 17 December 1851, the “Archives de l’État dans les Provinces” (State Archives in the Provinces) were placed under the authority of the National Archivist.\r\n\r\nNow broadly known as ‘the State Archives of Belgium', the National Archives and the State Archives in the Provinces are a federal academic organisation that forms part of the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO). The State Archives are made up of the National Archives in Brussels and 17 State Archives that are distributed throughout the country. The State Archives’ role is to ensure the proper preservation of archival documents produced and managed by the state authorities. In order to fulfil its responsibilities, the State Archives issue directives and recommendations; conduct inspections and organise training for civil servants. The State Archives also act as an advisory body for the construction and preparation of premises for the conservation of archives and for the organisation of archive management within public institutions. The State Archives obtain and preserve (following sorting) archival documents that are at least 30 years old from courts, tribunals, public authorities, notaries and from the private sector and private individuals (companies, politicians, associations and societies, influential families, etc. that have played an important role in society). They ensure that public archives are transferred according to strict archival standards.\r\n\r\nFrom 1996 onwards, the State Archives in Eupen became one of the departments of the State Archives of Belgium. As of 2013, they are under the operational management of the State Archives in the Walloon Provinces. "

                        "history": "\r\nThe gerechtelijke politie (GPP) / police judiciaire (PJP) (‘judicial police’) was created in 1919. Although propositions to create an autonomous judicial police had been made since the late 19th century, the project only gained widespread political support after the First World War, with the high crime rate during the Occupation having certainly played a role. The judicial police was under the authority and supervision of the procureurs-generaal, and was led by the procureurs des Konings of the different jurisdictions. The Commissariat Général / Commissariaat-Generaal (General Commissioner’s Office) was set up in 1936; it was in charge of the national coordination of the different brigades and of centralising information. Its missions ranged from infiltration and observation to gathering information from police informers – in other words, primarily repression of criminal offences and detection of violations of the law.\r\n\r\nThe judicial police of Brussels was by far the largest department (almost half of the total corps) and often operated in jurisdictions other than its own, due to the central role of the capital, the presence of particular forms of crime and the policy of centralisation of information from foreign and national agencies in Brussels. During the Second World War, the corps continued to function under the authority of secretary-general Gaston Schuind; due to the structurally understaffed police services of the occupier, Belgian judicial police officers were regularly called in. The corps was reinforced after the Liberation, out of fear of the left-wing of the resistance. The service remained virtually unchanged until the police reforms of 2001, when it was replaced by the Federal Police. The service had mainly repressive tasks: it investigated criminal activity, gathered evidence and brought offenders before the courts. In addition, it also monitored all kinds of political groups that potentially posed a threat to public security."

                        "history": "The legal basis for the Jewish faith’s recognition as an organised religion in Belgium country is the decree of 17 March 1808. Its official recognition by the Belgian State came about in 1832, via the Royal Decree of 21 May. A law of 4 March on the “temporal aspects of the faiths” stipulated the rights and duties of the recognised faiths in the kingdom. A Royal Decree of 23 February 1871 then confirmed the existence of the boards of directors of the five “synagogues” or communities that existed at the time, namely, those of Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent, Liège, and Arlon, under the aegis of the Jewish Central Consistory of Belgium. A Royal Decree of 7 February 1876, then went on to spell out the composition of the synagogues’ boards of directors and the procedures for electing their members (vote by secret ballot).\r\n\r\nEach community delegates one or more of its members to represent it in the Consistory. Together these delegates form the Consistorial Assembly, which meets several times a year. Seventeen Jewish communities are currently recognised: three in Antwerp, one in Arlon, seven in Brussels, one in Charleroi, one in Knokke, one in Liège, one in Ostend, and one in Waterloo. The Consistorial Assembly’s role is similar to that of a non-profit association’s general assembly. Decisions on daily management matters, for their part, are made by the Executive Board or “Bureau.” The Secretariat is responsible for the Consistory’s daily operation, in parallel with the executive officers.\r\n\r\nWhereas the Consistory’s role at the start was to represent and defend the temporal interests of the Jewish faith in dealing with the country’s civil authorities and to serve as the statutory speaking partner in all dealings with the State when it came to recognising the Jewish communities and appointing their religious officers, the range of matters within the Consistory’s purview has broadened greatly, especially since the end of World War II, ranging from religious observance to cultural matters with education and the media in between.This is the versatile framework within which the Consistory works, contributing to:\r\n\r\n- Jewish education through its Jewish religious education networks and support for the two university institutes of Jewish studies;\r\n\r\n- the preservation of Jewish cultural heritage through the establishment of the Jewish Museum of Belgium and Institute of Jewish Audiovisual Memory;\r\n\r\n- the study of the history of Belgian Judaism via the Contemporary Memory Foundation, which was created at the Consistory’s instigation;\r\n\r\n- remembrance of the Holocaust through the creation of Kazerne Dossin (formerly known as the Jewish Museum on Deportation and Resistance in Malines/Mechelen) and its involvement in annual events such as the commemoration in Boortmeerbeek of the attack on the 20th transport of deportees that took place April 19, 1943;\r\n\r\n- the dissemination of Jewish culture through the production of radio and television broadcasts concerning Judaism and the publication of a bilingual quarterly newsletter, *Nouvelles Consistoriales*/*Consistoriaal Nieuwsblad*;\r\n\r\n- interfaith dialogue on the highest level through its involvement in the consultative body for Christians and Jews in Belgium, the OCJB;\r\n\r\n- actions to take charge of the role of women in our country and problems of discrimination against women through the Jewish Women’s Council of Belgium, which is an active member of Belgium’s French-speaking and Flemish Women’s Councils; and\r\n\r\n- the organisation of the Jewish Heritage and Culture Days that are held as part of the annual “European Jewish Culture Day” in September."

In 1989 a team of researchers settled in at 74 Avenue de Stalingrad, above the Beth Israel synagogue. They introduced thirty exhibitions in parallel with the permanent exhibition. In 1999, the Belgian government conceded the Jewish Museum a group of buildings near the Sablon.

Characteristics of the Bulgarian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nBulgaria has a centralised archival system. The state archival institution has changed its name and departmental subordination several times. Now known as the Archives State Agency, its current status is regulated by National Archival Fonds Act, which was adopted in 2007. The organisation of and procedures governing access to the archival records are regulated by the [Law on the National Archival Fonds](http://www.archives.government.bg/images/1279111646.doc), the [Regulation on the procedures for use the records of the National Archival Fonds](http://www.archives.government.bg/uploaded_files/Regulation_USE__EN.pdf) and the [Rules for the procedures and organization of the archival records' use in Archives State Agency (ASA)](http://www.archives.government.bg/uploaded_files/Rules-order_and_organization_of_the_use.doc). All Bulgarian and foreign physical and juridical persons may use the records held by the ASA. The structure of the ASA includes a central archive and six directorates in the regional centres of Burgas, Varna, Tarnovo, Plovdiv, Montana and Sofia. Under them are all the other 27 regional archival branches of ASA. Several other archival institutions contain documents concerning the fate of Jews in Bulgaria during the Second World War. These are the State Military Historical Archives in the city of Veliko Turnovo, the Sofia City Archive, the Archive of the Bulgarian Academy of Science, as well archives in other countries. The most significant collections outside Bulgaria can be found in Yad Vashem, USHMM and different archives in Germany and Russia. The most important information for all future researchers is the expanding digital access to huge collection of archival documents concerning the fate of the Jews in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Bulgaria**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Bulgaria**\r\n\r\nThe Central State Archives and the regional archives hold different collections connected to the persecution and protection of the Bulgarian Jews during the Second World War as well as the deportation of the Macedonian and Thracian Jews. The biggest and most important among them are the record groups of the Commissariat for the Jewish Affairs. All archives are open to researchers and users. The entire collection is in the process of digitisation. Digital open access is provided, and referred to in the EHRI archival descriptions. Given the huge volume of documents, EHRI’s main aim for Bulgaria has been to present up-to-date and accurate information on the structure of the archives, contacts, logistical information, as well as a description of the volume of documents and a general content description of the main branches of the State Agency Archives and of the Central State Archives itself. EHRI has been able to provide up-to-date summaries of the structure of the fonds, the quantities of documents, as well as descriptions of a small number of representative archival units in these inventories. For example, the Fonds of Commissariat of Jewish Affairs [Комисарство по еврейските въпроси – КЕВ], which is available at the State Archives Agency, contains 15,348 archival units organised in three inventories. The EHRI portal includes links to the Archives State Agency for a number of digitized documents concerning the persecution and protection of Jews in Bulgaria during the Second World War.\r\n\r\n**C.II.

Two decades later on 2 January 1974 the Central State Technical Archives was created by order of the minister of information and communications, with the main objective to collect, process, preserve and organise the use of the valuable technical documents. In 1979, the CSHA became a national repository of copies of records relative to the Bulgarian history, kept in foreign archival centres.\r\n\r\nBy Council of Ministers’ Decree dated 30 December 1992, the archival system was reorganised and the three central archives merged into a sole Central State Archives (CSA) under the General Department of Archives. The offices, reading rooms, labs and repositories, which were dispersed before the unification, were assembled in 1992 in the building at 5 Moskovska Str. After a subsequent reconstruction and adaptation period, new repositories were equipped for the most valuable and frequently used records. On the basis of the contract signed in 1993 with the Supreme Council of BSP, the Archive accepted the documents of the former Central Party Archive. To avoid any duplication in the archival references, a range of letters were added to the numbers of the fonds: for the fonds of the former CSHA – K; for the fonds of the former CSTA – A; and for the fonds of the former CPA – Б. In 1999, the archive acquired the documents of the former “Bulgarian photography” EAD, which fulfilled the role of public photo archive.\r\n"

                "summary": "EHRI has identified a number of helpful archival guides on Belarus, some of which are available online. A list is provided in the EHRI extensive report on Belarus. EHRI established contact with central Belarusian archival authorities to facilitate future exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in the country.\r\n\r\nThe most important Belarusian archives for Holocaust research include the National Archives of the Republic of Belarus. Their collections cover German occupation organizations, Communist Party and Partisan organization files as well as the post-Liberation investigations of the Belarusian Extraordinary State Committee to Investigate German Fascist Crimes Committed on Soviet Territory. Similar files of a more local provenance are contained in the Regional Archives in Viciebsk, Mahilioŭ, Homiel, Hrodna and, most importantly, Brest, where larger collections containing material of Jewish origin also exist. EHRI has identified over 25 archival institutions in Belarus which hold Holocaust-relevant material. Seven of them are located in the country’s capital Minsk. For a complete list, see the EHRI extensive report on Belarus.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there are regional, “zonal” or otherwise specialized archives with Holocaust-relevant collections which can be found in 14 urban centers of Belarus, namely in Baranavičy, Babrujsk, Barysaŭ, Brest, Hlybokaje, Homiel, Kobryn, Lida, Mazyr, Orša, Pinsk, Polack, Rečyca and Viciebsk. They are also listed in the EHRI extensive report on Belarus. Based on a published finding aid, EHRI has identified over 230 collections spread over several repositories.\r\n\r\nOutside of Belarus, EHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections that may prove relevant to Holocaust research on Belarus, for instance in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Russia. In Israel, Yad Vashem holds significant documentation from archives in Belarus from 1930 to 1960, containing over 4,000 files. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum stores selected records from the Belarus Central State Archives and from the Homiel, Hrodna and Mahilioŭ regional archives.\r\n",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Belarus: Pre-existing research, available archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nEHRI’s exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in Belarus relied on some important pre-existing research in the field, such as Christian Gerlach’s *Kalkulierte Morde. Die deutsche Wirtschafts- und Vernichtungspolitik in Weißrußland 1941-1944* (1998), which had already made use of archival material available in the country. EHRI was also able to identify a number of helpful archival guides, some of which are available online.\r\n\r\nFor a general overview, which is also available in English, see:\r\n\r\nhttp://archives.gov.by/eng\r\n\r\nMore specialised archival guides include:\r\n\r\n- [2007] Stefan Karner & Vjačeslav Selemenev (Hg.), *Österreicher und Sudetendeutsche vor sowjetischen Militär- und Strafgerichten in Weißrussland 1945–1950* (Graz – Minsk, 2007). This guide provides information about the post-war trials\r\n\r\n- [2003] Kupovetsky, Mark, Eduard Savitsky & Marek Web (eds.), *Dokumenty po istorii i kulture evreev v arkhivach Belarusi* (Documents on the history and culture of Jews in the archives of Belarus) (Moscow: RGGU, 2003)\r\n\r\n- [2003] Zumar, Sergej V., *Dokumente zur Geschichte des Zweiten Weltkrieges in den Staatsarchiven der Republik Belarus. Ein Nachschlagewerk / Dokumenty po istorii Velikoi Otechestvennoi voiny v gosudarstvennykh arkhivach Respubliki Belarus* (Dresden: Ludwig-Boltzmann-Institut / Komitee f. Archiv- u. Schriftführung / Belarussisches Wissenschaftsforschungsinstitut / Nationalarchiv d. Republik Belarus / Stiftung Sächsische Gedenkstätten, 2003). This guide is available online, albeit only in Russian: http://archives.gov.by/index.php?id=156936\r\n\r\n- [1996] Sallis, Dorit & Marek Web (eds.), *Jewish Documentary Sources in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus: A Preliminary List* (New York: JTS, 1996).\r\nEHRI has also established contact with central Belarusian archival authorities in order to facilitate future exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in the country, whose full extent and importance have yet to be determined\r\n\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Belarusian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nMost of the central and regional Belarusian archives were founded during the pre-war Soviet period and suffered, to some extent, from fighting, evacuation or occupation. A smaller number of archival institutions was created and began to operate immediately after the German occupiers’ withdrawal from Belarus. There are also some more recently established archival institutions. As a result of regime changes and administrative reforms, many archival institutions in Belarus have been repeatedly renamed, which may cause some initial confusion among researchers.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Belarus**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Belarus**\r\n\r\nIn Belarus, EHRI identified over 25 archival institutions which hold or may hold Holocaust-relevant material on Belarus. Many of them are concentrated in the country’s capital, Minsk, and environs. Among the numerous provincial centres, the cities of Hrodna and Mahilioŭ each host two Holocaust-relevant archival institutions. Regional, zonal and otherwise specialised archives can be found in all other urban centres of Belarus, i.e. in Baranavičy (Baranovichi), Babrujsk (Bobruisk), Barysaŭ (Borisov), Brest, Dziaržynsk (Dzerzhinsk), Hlybokaje (Glubokoe), Homiel (Gomel), Kobryn (Kobrin), Lida, Mazyr (Mozyr), Orša (Orsha), Pinsk, Polack (Polotsk), Rečyca (Rechitsa) and Viciebsk (Vitebsk).\r\n\r\nThe abovementioned Belarusian archives hold vast numbers of valuable records on all conceivable aspects of the country’s general history: the Minsk-based National Archives alone stores about 1,200 fonds, and almost all regional or zonal archives hold similarly impressive numbers of collections. Given the dimension of mass murder in Belarus during the Second World War, many Holocaust-relevant collections are either known to be stored or can be expected to be found in the country’s archives. On the basis of Sergej V Zumar’s *Dokumente zur Geschichte des Zweiten Weltkrieges in den Staatsarchiven der Republik Belarus. Ein Nachschlagewerk / Dokumenty po istorii Velikoi Otechestvennoi voiny v gosudarstvennykh arkhivach Respubliki Belarus* (2003), EHRI has selected Holocaust-relevant collections among the general mass of sources in Belarus. The descriptions of these selected collections have been copied from the Belarusian online archival catalogue (http://fk.archives.gov.by/catalogue/).\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Belarus, EHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections that may prove relevant to Holocaust research on Belarus, for instance in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Russia. In Israel, Yad Vashem holds a significant documentation from archives in Belarus from 1930 to 1960, containing over 4,000 files. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum stores selected records from the Belarus Central State Archives and from the Homiel, Hrodna and Mahilioŭ regional archives.\r\n",

It is about the tragedy that took away lives of 90% of the Novogrudok Jewish community members (there had been more than 6000 people in it before the war) and about unprecedented resistance to the Nazi policy of annihilation of those who remained alive after the four massacres.\r\nThe memorial exhibition includes two rooms with the reconstructed barrack interior and the exhibition with the reconstructed tunnel entrance. The exhibition presents organizers and participants of the tunnel construction, it contains names and information available about all the prisoners who escaped through the tunnel.

But they had personally lived through the burdens of war and were enthusiastic in the creation of the Museum’s expositions, accepting materials from many sources to enrich the holdings of the Museum. In addition, they helped with the voluntary clear-up of Minsk, their home, from its war-time ruin. The war had just ended, and the wounds of war were aching still. That is why the conceptual basis of the Museum’s expositions was to portray fascism’s crimes against civilians and to show the historic fight of the Belarusian people against the Nazi invaders. \r\nIn 1964, the Museum was located at Karl Marx Street, 12. Two years later, in 1966, the Museum moved into a newly built three-story building on the Central Square (October Square today), where its expositions opened in 1967. "

Recognizing the need for their own social institutions, they established a public library to cherish the Yiddish language and culture that lay at the heart of this community. From its beginnings and into the 21st century, the Yidishe-folks-biblyotek, or Jewish Public Library (JPL) has continued to offer a familiar space that nourishes the intellectual, creative, and spiritual needs of the community.\r\n\r\nThe JPL opened its doors on May 1st, 1914 in a modest cold-water flat at 669 rue St. Urbain with a small collection of 500 books. From the beginning the Library was more than mere shelves and texts. It quickly became the meeting place for literary and cultural exchange, maintaining a link to the still flourishing Jewish communities of Eastern Europe while promoting the community’s growth in its new Quebec home. With the creation of the Yidishe folks universitet (YIFO) or the People’s University, the Library also became a centre for continuing education.\r\n\r\nThe Library developed out of the reading rooms of several community organizations including the Poale Zion, Baron de Hirsch Institute, and various synagogues. Yehuda Kaufman and Reuben Brainin, two well-known leaders in the community, led the charge to bring together these organizations into one public Library. These two men were joined by a legion of volunteers and groups devoted to the idea of a space for community members to better themselves through literature and learning. The cooperation of these groups, despite differences in language, politics, and religious beliefs, ensured the success of a library that was for the people and by the people.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the Library’s own building in 1952 on the corner of Mont-Royal and avenue de l’Esplanade, placed it squarely in the heart of the community. The new Library was within metres of the Young Men’s -Young Women’s Hebrew Association, Fletcher’s Field (Parc Jeanne Mance), the Hebrew Old People’s and Sheltering Home, as well as synagogues and other communal organizations. The role of the Library as a cultural centre was reflected in the inclusion of an auditorium, gallery and meeting spaces, a music room, and an art room. By mid-century, the community began to move from the Main to the western suburbs of the city. Following its members, the Library sold its building in 1966 eventually moved to its current location on chemin de la Côte Ste-Catherine.\r\n\r\nOver its hundred year history, the JPL continued to respond to the needs of immigrant groups through its collections, programmes, and services. In the 1960s the JPL welcomed thousands of Jewish immigrants from North Africa with services in French. Later, waves of immigrants from Russia, France, Israel, Ethiopia, and South America were equally welcomed into the JPL."

This prompted the Canadian Jewish Congress (CJC) Central Region to work with the TJHS to establish an organization that would preserve records of Jewish communities across Ontario. At a CJC Central Region Officers’ meeting in 1973, TJHS president Victor Sefton proposed that the Historical Society’s Archives Committee become an official arm of the CJC. After approving the proposal, the CJC Central Region allocated a budget for operation of the Archives, forming one archival organization that operated under the umbrella of the CJC Central Region.\r\n\r\nSince 1973, the OJA has undergone unofficial and official name changes. When first established the OJA was called the Canadian Jewish Congress Central Region Archives. After the Toronto Jewish Congress (TJC) formed in 1976, the OJA became accountable to the TJC but continued to report to the CJC Central Region. OJA letterhead and publicity material during this period occasionally bore the name Toronto Jewish Congress / Canadian Jewish Congress Central Region Archives. When the Archives became a legal corporation in 1977, the corporation was named the Ontario Jewish Archives Foundation but the public name remained unchanged. \r\n\r\nIn 1992, the TJC and CJC transferred responsibility for the archives to the United Jewish Appeal (UJA) Federation, and the archives’ public name officially became the Ontario Jewish Archives (OJA). The OJA remains a department of UJA Federation today. Thanks to a generous donation made by the Blankenstein family in 2014, the OJA's public name changed to the Ontario Jewish Archives, Blankenstein Family Heritage Centre (OJA)."

The funds advanced by the Claims Conference were administered by the CJC which also gave support by providing the URO with office space and clerical staff. Offices were set up in Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver. The Winnipeg and Vancouver offices closed in the 1970s and the Montreal office remained open until 2002, after which time the active cases were sent to the Toronto office. The Toronto office officially closed on April 1, 2007. There was one case worker, however, who contintued to tend to any active claims that were left. Her position was transfered to Jewish Family and Child in 2013. The URO dealt with a variety of different types of claims. The first and largest were the BEG cases (Bundesentschaedigungsgesetz), which translates as Federal Indemnification Law for the Compensation of Victims of National Socialist Persecution. This program provided compensation for individuals persecuted for political, racial, religious, or ideological reasons who suffered long-term damage to their health, imprisonment, death of family members, loss of property, reduced income, or reduced professional advancement. The other two major programs or cases covered by the URO were the Hardship Fund and Article 2. The Hardship Fund was established during the 1960s and was open to Jews who emigrated from the former Soviet Union who were not eligible for compensation under the BEG program. The Article 2 program, in turn, arose during the 1990s, after the unification of the German government. It is still operating today and is open to Jewish victims of Nazi persecution who met a certain critiera, and those who are eligible, are provided with a pension paid out in installments every three months each year."

It was a complicated project brought to fruition by many committees but guided particularly by the VHCS Executive Director at the time, Ronnie Tessler, and Board member, Arthur Pouchet. The architects, Peter Rees and Jack Lutsky, and Museum of Anthropology consultant, David Cunningham and, were key participants. The Vancouver Holocaust Education Centre opened in the fall of 1994 with the inaugural exhibit Anne Frank in The World: 1929–1945, an internationally acclaimed exhibition produced by the Anne Frank Center USA, New York.\r\n\r\nRobert Krell served as founding President of the Board of Directors of the Vancouver Holocaust Centre Society from its inception to 1998, when Robbie Waisman assumed the Presidency. During Krell’s tenure, Dr. Roberta Kremer who had earlier consulted to the VHCS on the proposed Centre, was hired to be the Executive Director. Frieda Miller was added to our small but effective staff as Director of Education. Rome Fox came aboard as Coordinator of Volunteers on a part-time basis.\r\n\r\nThe VHEC Collections were formally created when the Vancouver Holocaust Education Centre Society opened the VHEC in 1994, and have continued to grow ever since. Survivors and their families have donated personal items, which are accessible to researchers along with gifts from private collectors, military veterans, community members and academics.

                        "name": "Archives d'Etat de Genève",
                        "history": "In the Middle Ages, Geneva was subject to the authority of the bishop. From the 14th century onwards, however, the community of citizens and burghers of Geneva began to develop its autonomy by obtaining rights and privileges. This implied the development of a communal authority and the appearance of titles, legal documents proving rights, in other words, the appearance of archives. From the middle of the 15th century onwards, archives, repositories and research tools were available in Geneva.\r\n\r\nOver time, as this community became more and more important, and then sovereign with the departure of the bishop at the beginning of the 16th century, the archives became increasingly important. Although the question of their management periodically comes up in the deliberations of the authorities, in practice it remains very summary. Unlike in other European states, there was no archivist or registrar responsible for their management. Until the end of the seventeenth century, each office kept its archives separately. In the eighteenth century, although still dispersed, efforts to reorganise them improved the situation.\r\n\r\nThroughout this period, the archives and the inventories that describe them were created according to the needs of the administration. They serve above all to prove the titles and rights of the community. Their availability to historians is extremely limited, as archives are above all a place of state secrecy. It was not until the Restoration that the archives were gradually opened to the public. It must be said that the change of regime, a new Europe, a territory redrawn by the Congress of Vienna, the treaties of Paris and Turin as well as the entry of Geneva into the Confederation rendered a large part of the documents obsolete. The archives, which until then had been scattered in various places, were brought together and placed under the responsibility of a \"guardian\" in 1815. However, classification of the archives did not begin until 1839 with the appointment of the first archivist, Louis Sordet. Within the archives, history then took its place alongside legal and administrative functions. The public at the time was the generation of historians who founded the Société d'histoire et d'archéologie de Genève."

                        "name": "Schweizerisches Sozialarchiv",
                        "history": "The Swiss Social Archives were founded in 1906 under the name of “Centre for Switzerland’s Social Literature”. The aim of the Centre was to document “the social question” and to “make this collection available free-of-charge to all interested parties”. The initiative was taken by Paul Pflüger, a social reformer and pastor from the working-class district of Aussersihl. Inspired by a visit to the Musée Social in Paris on the occasion of the 1900 World Exhibition, Paul Pflüger devoted himself intensively to documenting the social question. The association had a non-partisan composition right from the start. All the key political and denominational directions were represented, in order to ensure that the newly-created institution worked on a scientifically objective basis.\r\n\r\nIn January 1907, the reading room and lending service were launched in a two-room flat at Seilergraben 31. For the first few years, the “Centre for Social Literature” was run as a one-man undertaking. The first person in charge was Gustav Büscher; he was succeeded in 1909 by Sigfried Bloch who, together with his wife, Rosa Bloch-Bollag, was a prominent representative of the Swiss labour movement at that time. In 1919, the “Centre” was able to move into new and bigger premises on the ground floor of the former chancel of the “Predigerkirche”.\r\nUnder its new manager, Paul Kägi (1929-1941), the Centre increased its staff numbers slightly – three permanent jobs were created for looking after the reading room and performing the increasing amount of cataloguing and office work. During the economic crisis, the Centre was also able to take on so-called “public relief workers” for longer or shorter periods of time.\r\n\r\nThe institution then underwent considerable expansion between 1942 and 1946 under its new manager, Eugen Steinemann. When Eugen Steinemann took up office in 1942, the name of the institute was also changed to “Swiss Social Archives”.\r\n\r\nOn 2 June 1957, the Swiss Social Archives were able to move into a new building at Neumarkt 28. The move had necessitated long, drawn-out negotiations with the municipal and cantonal authorities, as well as the referendum of 8 July 1956 on the loans that were necessary. Following the death of Eugen Steinemann, Jakob Ragaz (1903-1985) took over as manager of the Social Archives in 1966.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by Miroslav Tucek in 1968. It was during the latter’s time that the Social Archives were recognised by the Swiss Confederation in the framework of the Universities Promotion Act (1974), and moved to their present location in the Sonnenhof at Stadelhoferstrasse 12 (1984). Under Miroslav Tucek’s leadership, the Social Archives underwent considerable expansion and developed into an institution with a nationwide and international reach.\r\nIn 1988, the first female director, Anita Ulrich, was appointed to the Swiss Social Archives. Under her leadership, the Social Archives made the move into the age of new information technologies, which are opening up new opportunities for disseminating the collection that has been constantly expanded in quantitative terms and with regard to the subjects covered. It was also during her time in office that the Swiss Social Archives started a systematic collection of audio-visual sources and a research fund was set up; this was made possible by a gift from sociologist Ellen Rifkin Hill who died in 1999. When Anita Ulrich retired in 2014, Christian Koller was appointed as the new director.\r\n\r\n[Read more...](extension://elhekieabhbkpmcefcoobjddigjcaadp/https://www.sozialarchiv.ch/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/100_Jahre_Sozialarchiv_2006.pdf)"

At the same time, in 1837, the various special archives of the canton began to merge into a central archive, which for the first time appeared independently in the Fraumünsteramt. Finally, from then on, permission from the government council was no longer required for outsiders to use the archives.\r\n\r\n[A text](https://www.zh.ch/content/dam/zhweb/bilder-dokumente/organisation/direktion-der-justiz-und-des-innern/staatsarchiv/Handbuch_historische_Buchbest%C3%A4nde_2007.pdf) prepared in 2007 for a handbook deals with various aspects of the history of the State Archives. It also contains a list of older literature on the history of the archives.\r\n\r\nThe State Archive of Zurich is the archive of the Swiss Canton of Zurich and its legal predecessors, in particular the City State of Zurich. The historical holdings of the State Archive date back to the year 853 - the founding charter of the Fraumünster is the oldest surviving document - and have a significance that extends far beyond the canton. The continuity of tradition is considered remarkable, thanks to the absence of major catastrophes and wars. The more recent holdings of the Canton of Zurich (since 1831) form the bulk of the archive holdings in terms of quantity, comprising some 30 kilometres of files and documents, to which a few terabytes of electronic data material are added."

In the 1820s the archive moved to the new government building in the front suburb. In 1959, the State Archive and the Cantonal Library moved into a new building designed especially for them. The organisational separation of the two institutions in 1967 was also spatially completed in 1998 when the State Archive moved to the new Buchenhof administration building. The move to the new building brought about a marked improvement in internal operational processes. The archive users have a modern and purpose-oriented working environment in the Buchenhof."

                        "history": "In 1798, the Councillors of the Helvetic Republic (1798–1803) decide to establish a national archive. The Archive of the Helvetic Republic becomes Switzerland’s first central archive. It changes location on a number of occasions, as it is always situated at the headquarters of the Helvetic Republic. The core of the archive consists of treaties and other diplomatic documents. During the Mediation Period (1803–1813), the Restoration (1814–1830) and the Regeneration (1830–1848) it grows steadily. Its home is in Bern city hall. With the foundation of the Federal State, the “Federal Archive” becomes part of the Federal Chancellery. In 1849 Johann Jakob Meyer, Secretary of the Federal Chancellery, becomes the first “federal archivist”.\r\n\r\nThe first detailed regulations on the Federal Archive come into force on 14 September 1864 and apply to documents from 1798 to 1848 as well as “the new Federal Archive” from 6 November 1848. Overall supervision is entrusted to the Federal Department of Home Affairs, and the Archive is headed by an archivist. Archive records are divided into 13 main sections, with each relating to an area of activity, such as “Justice” or “Telegraphy”.\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the Federal Archive is in what today is the western section of the Swiss Parliament building. The archivist from 1868 onwards is Jakob Kaiser, who joined as a temporary assistant in 1860. His biggest problem is lack of space. Having visited archives abroad, he launches a successful campaign for the Archive to have its own building. The Federal Assembly grants a loan of 67,000 Swiss francs for the purchase of land in the Kirchenfeld district, where little construction has taken place at the time, and for the construction of the building that today houses the Federal Archives.\r\n\r\nThe new building – initially shared with the National Library – allows the Archive and its staff, which has now grown to four, to establish “exemplary order”, as a sub-committee of the National Council notes with approval. It is needed, because the tasks of the Archive are growing: at the beginning of the 20th century, its main activity is publishing editions of files. In 1914, it receives its first typewriter. The official name “Federal Archives” (“Bundesarchiv”) is bestowed in the same year.\r\n\r\nAfter the First World War, at the behest of the Control Committee of the Council of States, the Federal Archives step up their research into foreign affairs and build up their academic contacts within Switzerland. Research assistant Léon Kern lectures at the University of Lausanne. From 1925, now as a junior archivist, he also serves as Professor of Medieval History at the University of Bern. In 1934, having been promoted to federal archivist, he becomes a member of the council of the General Society of Historical Researchers of Switzerland (AGGS).\r\n\r\nThe 1930s see an increase in the number of visitors to the reading room and written enquiries. The “sport of doctorates”, which Jakob Kaiser bemoaned as early as 1904, appears to be growing year by year. It is obvious that clear guidelines on the use of the Archives are needed. On 9 May 1944, the Federal Council approves the “Regulations on the Communication and Lending of Files of the Federal Archives”. These stipulate that files which “date from at least 50 years ago” are accessible to the public “in general and without restriction”. The number of employees continues to grow after the Second World War in response to rising visitor numbers and new responsibilities. The Federal Archives acquire their first microfilm reader in 1963 and their first copier in 1965.\r\n\r\nIncreased interest in the Federal Archives manifests itself in the 1960s in the discussion on a proposal put forward by National Councillor Olivier Reverdin. Entitled “Opening up the Federal Archives to academic research”, it criticises the impossibility of conducting an independent investigation into Swiss neutrality in the two world wars because of long closure periods. The complaint finds a receptive audience. Although the new regulations of 15 July 1966 retain the 50-year closure period, for the first time they provide for exceptions to be made in the case of academic research. Seven years later the closure periods are shortened again, to 35 years.\r\n\r\nThe research activity made possible by these changes is fundamental to the understanding of contemporary Swiss history. During the 1990s, as Switzerland’s role during the Second World War is undergoing a reappraisal, it also creates a new kind of Federal Archives: an institution that, through exhibitions, debates and publications, engages increasingly with the public. At the same time the Federal Archives lend their support to the Federal Act on Archiving of 26 June 1998. This shortens the closure period to 30 years and abolishes preferential access to documents for the academic research community.\r\n\r\nAt the dawn of the new millennium, the Federal Archives face a new challenge: as they are increasingly called upon to archive digital documents, new concepts and different skills for archivists are required. The shift from paper to digital shapes the modernisation of all the Federal Archives’ services. It also opens up a whole range of new ways for society to make use of archived information."

After the Grand Council granted two successive credits for the construction, the ACV moved in on 15 April 1985. "

                        "history": "The State Archive of Bern is the repository of all state archival holdings worthy of preservation. Since the 15th century, the Bernese archives have been housed in the vaults of the town hall. In 1713 a permanent archive commission was set up. The archives of the perished city and Republic of Bern went to the newly created Canton of Bern in 1803, and partly to the Cantons of Aargau and Vaud. Until 1891, the administration of the National Archive was the responsibility of the respective state scribe.\r\n\r\nIn archiving terms, the first twenty years of this century has seen the State Archive make considerable advances. The introduction of an archive information system (2005), the publication of all the directory units in the online inventory and online access to specialist library holdings (2009) have made it possible to conduct research throughout the Archive’s holdings from anywhere in the world at any time. The Cantonal Parliament’s adoption of the Archiving Act (2009) and its entry into force along with the related ordinance on 1 January 2010 was a very important milestone for the State Archive. The new legislation codified archiving tasks for the first time in a cantonal act in line with the law on freedom of information and data protection and laid down principles for the more efficient organisation of archiving work. The law also gave electronic documents an equivalent status to documents on paper, thus defining digital archiving as a new task.\r\n\r\nBased on these new legal principles, the Cantonal Parliament decided on 1 September 2014 to begin a comprehensive programme of digital records and process management and archiving (DGA), at the same time approving the funding required for the 2015–2022 period. You will find more information on this trendsetting project here."

                        "name": "Staatsarchiv Sankt Gallen",
                        "history": "Like the canton itself, the State Archive was created in 1803. Initially, the focus of its archival activity was on legal documents from the early years of the Swiss Confederation and the subsequent transitional period from 1798 to the foundation of the canton. The change in legal structure during this time led to the transfer of archival records to other cantons. Archival records, such as those from the bailiwicks of Rheintal or Sax, were finally able to be incorporated into the St. Gallen State Archive. However, some of the proposed acquisitions were difficult and some failed.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the State Archive was able to acquire other valuable archives belonging to public bodies from the period before the canton was founded, such as the Rheineck Town Archive and the Lichtensteig Town Archive.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the canton consisted of twelve independent ‘states’ prior to 1798 is reflected in the archival landscape. For example, not all the written records from these regions are held in the State Archive. Important archival records from the period before the founding of the canton can be found in the Abbey Archive and in the St. Gallen Local Authority City Archive (the archive of the former imperial city and republic of St. Gallen), in various other cantonal archives and in communal archives in the canton. There is currently no overview of all the archival records relating to St. Gallen in other Swiss archives from before 1798. However, the cantonal records since 1803 have been secured, although there are gaps in certain periods. Important privately-owned records have been acquired in recent years and the State Archive has developed a consistent process for overseeing and evaluating records, which has been in place since 2003. In addition, the State Archive plays a significant role in digital preservation. In this and other areas, it collaborates with other archives both nationally and internationally (e.g. archives in the Arge Alp)."

The 19th century saw the first attempts at centralisation in the municipal archives system. In view of the incorporation of Zurich in 1893 (takeover of 11 municipal archives), the creation of an archive plan became urgent. This resulted in the division of the archival material into ten sections, designated with Roman numerals (1894). At that time, the city archive was headed by the substitute of the city clerk; organisationally, it belonged to the city chancellery. Although the Municipal Code of the City of Zurich, in force since 1893, had already envisaged a City Archivist as head of the municipal archives \"for the archival business\" (Municipal Code of 24 July 1892, Art. 63), this position was not created until 1930. From 1909 onwards, the Zurich City Archives had a permanent archivist for the first time, which meant that it could be continuously looked after. At the same time, the City Archives opened up to the public. The municipal ordinance of 15 January 1933 finally separated the City Archives from the City Chancellery. With the second incorporation, another 8 municipal archives were added to the Zurich City Archives in 1934."

EHRI approach to Czechia: Pre-existing Research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Czechia, EHRI was able to rely on a number of pre-existing works, including Livia Rothkirchen’s *The Jews of Bohemia and Moravia. Facing the Holocaust* (2005), works by Miroslav Kárný, the Theresienstädter Studien und Dokumente and other publications. EHRI identified a number of resources useful for Holocaust researchers:\r\n- [2008] Sedláková, Monika. “Co skrývají Okupační vězeňské spisy” in *Terezínské listy* 36 (2008): 198–210.\r\n- [2005] Ptáčníková, Světlana/Vaničková, Vladimíra, “Judaika v Archivu Ministerstva vnitra” in *Sborník Archivu Ministerstva vnitra* 3 (2005): 321-342.\r\n- [2005] Tůma, Oldřich/Jitka Svobodová/Ulrich Mählert, Vademecum Contemporary History Czech Republic. *A Guide to Archives, Research Institutions, Libraries, Associations, Museums and Places of Memorial* (Prague: Institute for Contemporary History, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, 2005).\r\n- [1987] *Státní ústřední archiv v Praze. Průvodce po archivních fondech a sbírkách* (Praha: TEPS, 1987).\r\n- The [National Archives Portal](https://portal.nacr.cz/cro/en/) is the central database of archival collections in Czechia.\r\n- Holocaust.cz portal provides access, apart from other materials, to the database of Holocaust victims and to a growing body of digitised archival material (mostly from the National Archives, but also from other archival institutions).\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Czech archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe Archival system in Czechia consists of the state archives, particularly the National Archives in Prague, and 7 regional archives, which are subordinate to the National Archival Administration [Odbor archivní správy a spisové služby] of the Ministry of Interior. Two other archives, in Opava and Brno, are also de facto regional archives, but are called Zemský, or Land archives, for historical reasons. Furthermore, there are 70 district archives which are subordinated to the respective regional archives. In addition to the mentioned archives, there exist also several specialed and private archives, memory institutions, museums and libraries. Furthermore, there are five archives of the territorial self-governing units worth emphasising, in Prague, Brno, Ostrava, Plzeň and Ústí nad Labem.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Czechia** \r\n\r\n**C. I. In Czechia** \r\n\r\nCollections relating to the Second World War and the Holocaust can be found not only in the abovementioned state archives, but also in the Military History Archives, the National Film Archives, the Archive of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and the State Security Archive (which holds the archives of the former communist security services). Furthermore, there is the Terezín Memorial in the former Theresienstadt ghetto which acts as a museum, archive and research institute. Non-state institutions doing research and collecting documents on the Holocaust include the Jewish Museum in Prague and the Prague-based Terezín Initiative Institute, which was founded by former inmates of the Theresienstadt ghetto. In October 2018, EHRI imported 165 top-level archival descriptions prepared by the Jewish Museum in Prague within the framework of the cooperation between EHRI and the [Yerusha project](http://yerusha.eu/).\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nEHRI has yet to determine which archival institutions and collections outside of Czechia are relevant to Holocaust research on Czechia. Some holdings of Yad Vashem and Beit Terezin (Israel) have been included in the [EHRI research guides](https://portal.ehri-project.eu/guides/terezin). The USHMM has conducted an extended copying program in the Czech archives, in particular in the National Archives in Prague. Yad Vashem has copied a significant amount of material from the Archives of the Jewish Museum in Prague.\r\n",

In 1947, 53 Jewish Religious Communities were recognised by the state and the Council brought them together under one organisation. After the fall of the communist regime in 1989, the Council transformed into the Federation of Jewish Communities in the Czech Republic and it now acts as an umbrella organisation for Jewish religious communities.

                        "history": "The Masaryk Institute and Archive of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Public Research Institute, is an ASCR research institute. Its uniqueness derives from the interdisciplinary overlap of its research spheres (particularly history, archive science, historical auxiliary disciplines, politology and literary history). It is engaged in research into the modern history of the Czech Lands in the Central European context with the accent on Masaryk and Beneš research and the history of research institutes and researchers, as well as focusing on archive keeping and codicology. Its activities also include the acceptance and processing of archive materials from ASCR establishments and archive materials originating in the activities of individual researchers. It also deals on a contractual basis with the T. G. Masaryk Institute Civic Advisory Centre archive and book fonds. The Institute provides servicing and consultation services of a research and informational nature and arranges supervision of ASCR record management.\r\n\r\nThis establishment was created 1. 1. 2006 through the attachment of the ASCR Masaryk Institute to the ASCR Archive. In compliance with Act No. 341/2005 Coll. on Public Research Institutes, its status and thus its name changed to Masaryk Institute  Archive of the ASCR, Public Research Institute, and from 1. 1. 2008 to Masaryk Institute and Archive of the ASCR, Public Research Institute.\r\n\r\nASCR Archive:\r\n\r\nThe Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences Archive launched its activities on 1.1.1953 as a public institution incorporated within the Czechoslovak archival system. In 1956 it became a \"Special Archive\" and in 1974 an \"Archive of Special Importance\". Its main tasks included and continue to include the collection and processing of materials that derive from the activities of former research establishments and associations, institutes and organizational units at CSAS or ASCR and the personal papers of leading Czech scholars and scientists. Since 1955 it has been involved in the activities of the Commission for the Cataloguing and Study of Manuscripts Archive. As of 1.1.1966 the internal status of the archive within CSAS was decided and the establishment changed its name to CSAS Central Archive.\r\n\r\nThe first fonds to be administered comprised documents from the Royal Bohemian Learned Society, the Czech Academy of Sciences and Arts, the Masaryk Academy of Labour and the Czechoslovak National Research Council. In addition to accepting fonds the Archive also established photographic and artistic collections and at the same time performed independent scholarly tasks involving the history of research institutes, Czech science and scholarship, archive keeping and the cataloguing and study of manuscripts. The first Guide to the fonds, published in 1962, comprised 48 fonds and collections. Since the end of the 1960s specialist working sections have been established, i.e. CSAS predecessors and CSAS personal papers and fonds. Thanks to an increase in the number of staff members pre-archive care has been enhanced and in 1972 the first official specimen document management and safe disposal regulations were published for CSAS and the CSAS Archive Reports periodical started publication (1970-1985). From the mid-1980s the Archive's historical works focused more on the history of science and were published by Práce z djin SAV (Works from CSAS history).\r\n\r\n\r\nMasaryk Institute:\r\n\r\nThe T. G. Masaryk Institute was established by Tomáš G. Masaryk on 23. 7. 1932 as a foundation aiming to administer and supplement the TGM Library and Archive, to continue editing and publishing Masaryk's writings, to allow for external study by researchers and to publish the results of their works or to assist such publication. TGM donated his own private library and archive, his private museum and securities (worth around 10 million crowns) as the material basis for the foundation. This initial collection was meant to form the basis for a study of the areas with which Masaryk had dealt. The first home for the Institute was in Prague Castle, then in 1938 it moved to its own building in Bubeneč. During the war it was deposited in the Clementinum, because its building was occupied by the Gestapo. During the postwar restoration the Institute got its building back, but its premises were now inadequate, so it moved in 1948 to Kramář's Villa in Hradčany and immediately after that into a building on Národní třída 3. In 1954 the Masaryk Institute was closed down as part of an anti -Masaryk campaign, but then 1968 saw an attempt to renew its activities.\r\n\r\nOn 4th January 1990 President Václav Havel decided to restore the T. G. Masaryk Institute on the basis of a proposal by the Masaryk Society Committee. In 1995 it was established together with the ASCR Masaryk Institute Foundation, which took over the administration of the Archive and the Library, and as an independent establishment within the ASCR it provided space for Masaryk research in broader contexts. Since 2006 it as been a part of the Masaryk Institute and Archive of the ASCR."

A stronger foundation came with the government regulation on Archives in 1954. The archive was organizationally subordinate to the Regional Administration of the Ministry of the Interior and the number of its employees was expanded. Commissioning of new archival material always meant a lot of effort, due to a lack of storage space. It took a lot of persuasion, reasoning, and ultimately improvisation and physical toil. By 1992, the State Regional Archive in Prague managed to secure an additional 7,000 linear meters. The decisive turnaround came in the second half of the nineties, after the construction of new archival depositories in the area, which added up to a total of 31,820 linear meters extra space. All archives are stored in optimum conditions, complying with the strictest standards. A new stage has come with the relocation of the State Regional Archive to the archive area on Chodovci, one of the most modern archive buildings in Europe. Extensive changes necessitated the reorganization of the public administration in 2002. State Regional Archive in Prague became a state organization incorparating the 12 district archives of the Central Region, which became its internal organizational units."

                        "name": "Archiv hlavního města Prahy",
                        "history": "The beginnings of Prague's Municipal Archive can be seen in the collections of documentary privileges, which had been deposited, being the proofs of the freedoms of that which town, in the homes of the aldermen, or in the office of the justice of peace; and when town halls came to be built, they were stored in metal-sheathed chests in town hall chambers. These documents, so fundamental for the city, were soon joined by administrative documents from the individual towns of Prague, court materials and even private documents, due to the relative safety of storage. The increasing numbers of documents necessitated ever larger storage facilities, leaving only the most valuable documents in the chests, while other materials, above all books, moved to cabinets in separate chambers administered by the municipal scribe. The scribe, or scrivener, made the earliest lists and registers of the archive's contents when the documents were just too numerous for easy account.\r\n\r\nThe four originally independent towns of Prague (Old Town, New Town, Lesser Quarter, and the Castle) were united in 1784, and in the place of their respective self-governing bodies there was appointed a board of municipal authorities sitting at the Old Town Hall. In due course, all the archival documents from the unified towns were deposited there. Next to the archival documents' legal value, their great historical value, mirroring the story of the metropolis, and the cultural and political history of our lands, began to be appreciated with the development of modern historiographical research. This attitude was decisive for establishing of the municipal archive as a separate institution in 1851 when Karel Jaromír Erben was appointed the first municipal archivist. That year saw commencement at the archive (termed \"an auxiliary municipal office\" in contemporary parlance) of systematic work to make accessible the valuable municipal collections, above all the collections of documents and manuscripts, and to utilize their historical importance. A new department of city plans and depictions of the city was set up and the foundation was laid for an extensive history and law library. The archive also acquired commensurate premises in the north wing of the Old Town Hall, where, next to the depositories, space was found for a well-equipped reading room, a photo studio, and a conservation workshop. Its technical facilities and skilled staff made the Archive of the Capital of Prague one of the best state-of-the art archive institutions in our country in the period between the world wars.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi occupation was a sad period in the Archive's history. Its funds and staff were continuously cut and its archival materials were taken away from Prague to countryside depositories to protect them from air raids. The Archive was dealt a lethal blow in the very end of the war on 8 May 1945 during the fire of the Old Town Hall caused by the withdrawing German units. Together with the premises there burned down also a portion of archival documents, causing irreplaceable losses to the historical heritage of Prague.\r\n\r\nThe time to heal wounds came after the end of the war. The Archive obtained substitute premises at the Clam-Gallas Palace in Husova (Jan Hus) Street, where a part of its documents had been stored during the occupation. As the newly established depositories were being equipped with the stacks, the archives were carted back to Prague and new archival tools were gradually put together to replace the ones that had been consumed by fire. A reading room reopened in 1949. Since at that time construction of a new dedicated edifice turned out to be a pipe dream, the Palace was confirmed in the same year as the Archive's permanent location. Another trying period for the archive began in the 1950's. During 1950-1951 the archive lost a considerable segment of its staff but also its organizational independence since it was made to report to the internal affairs section of the Central National Committee of the Capital of Prague. But significant paper-pushing duties in the form of shredding of documents from national committees, schools, courts, companies and other organizations were added to its agenda. The archive was swamped with a plethora of materials hastily glanced over, including the archives of associations or church institutions that were shut down. Frequently they were obtained in a bad physical shape and unorganized without requisite catalogs and thus denied the opportunity to be scholarly utilized. In the following years the archive gradually reinstated its scholarly activities. It managed to increase the numbers of its professional archivists and to obtain and equip additional facilities to store its collections. Even the Clam-Gallas Palace was gradually renovated and refurbished. The staff picked up where pre-war publication efforts had left off and commenced intensive collaboration with history-oriented facilities at the Charles University and other institutions.\r\n\r\nThis positive trend received a decisive impetus through the November 1989 revolution. The Archive became a separate department of Prague City Council and in the eyes of the public it gained on importance as it provided significant archival evidence in restitution and rehabilitation cases. To a larger degree than any time before it has been receiving contemporary technology, above all computers and replication technology and the numbers of its staff have gone up as well. After more than half a century of waiting in vain, its space problems were finally over with the new dedicated Chodov archive in Prague 4, completed in 1997. (In the late 1980's the archive used along with the Clam-Gallas Palace an additional 8, mostly unsatisfactory, depositories in and outside of Prague, which included a chateau and an anti-fallout shelter.) In Fall 1998 a new state-of-the-art reading room opened there. Archive materials from the other depositories are being gradually regrouped here.\r\n"

                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Germany: Pre-existing research and archival guides**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Germany, research on the Holocaust has been conducted worldwide and for decades now. It follows that a full and up-to-date account of the available literature cannot be given here. However, a reference to the 16-volume series *Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der europäischen Juden durch das nationalsozialistische Deutschland 1933-1945* is appropriate, especially volumes 1-16 (published 2008-2018). This series is co-published by EHRI-partner Institute for Contemporary History Munich-Berlin [Institut für Zeitgeschichte München-Berlin, IfZ]. All volumes contain introductions based on international research. A translation of the series into English under the title *The Persecution and Murder of European Jews by Nazi Germany, 1933–1945* is under preparation with the cooperation of Yad Vashem; Volume 1-5, 12 were published in 2019-2022. Furthermore, there is the series Benz, Wolfgang / Distel, Barbara, *Der Ort des Terrors. Geschichte der nationalsozialistischen Konzentrationslager*, Volumes 1-9.\r\n\r\nResearch on the genocide of the Sinti and Roma began late; the most important and comprehensive publication to date is Michael Zimmermann's habilitation: *Rassenutopie und Genozid. Die nationalsozialistische Lösung der Zigeunerfrage*, Hamburg: Christians 1996 (available online at https://zeitgeschichte-hamburg.de/publikation-detail/band-33.html). Since summer 2020, the \"Encyclopaedia of the Nazi Genocide of Sinti and Roma in Europe\", which is funded by the Federal Foreign Office, has been under development at the Research Centre on Antiziganism at Heidelberg University and has set itself the task of compiling, scientifically processing and making available the existing knowledge of the persecution and murder of Sinti and Roma in Europe (see https://encyclopaedia-gsr.eu/eng/).\r\n\r\nWith the help of IfZ, EHRI has been able to identify a number of other Holocaust-relevant online resources and archival guides on Germany.\r\n\r\nAn important online resource is the Zentrale Datenbank Nachlässe, provided by the Bundesarchiv, at http://www.nachlassdatenbank.de/\r\n\r\nThe following archival guides are also available:\r\n- [2023] *Archive in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz. Ein Adressenverzeichnis* (Münster: Ardey, 2023) [lists all archives],\r\n- [1996-2001] Jersch-Wenzel, Stefi & Andreas Reinke (eds), *Quellen zur Geschichte der Juden in den Archiven der neuen Bundesländer* (München: Saur, 1996-2001, multiple volumes, 1-6b),\r\n- [1995] Bauch, Herbert, *Quellen zu Widerstand und Verfolgung unter der NS-Diktatur in hessischen Archiven.

Kahlenberg, Julius H. Schoeps und Hanno Loewy Verlag für Berlin-Brandenburg, Potsdam 1996-1997.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the German archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nGermany exhibits a highly differentiated archival system without much centralization. In addition to the Federal Archives and their departments (governed by the Bundesarchivgesetz or Federal Archive Law), each Bundesland has its own State Archive, governed by the respective state archive law. There are over 1,300 municipal archives. The religious communities in Germany, first and foremost bodies and organizations of the Catholic and Protestant Churches as well as the Jewish community, exhibit a rich array of archival institutions. There are also university archives, archives of noble houses and a number of other, mostly topical archives as well as libraries holding archival material.\r\n\r\nKey institutions identified by EHRI include the Bundesarchiv [Federal Archive with all its departments] and the respective state archives [Landes-, Hauptstaats- and Staatsarchive] of the German Bundesländer as well as the Geheimes Staatsarchiv Berlin (for former Prussian institutions), which hold surviving files of central and regional administrative bodies, occupation authorities, the Nazi Party, personnel and membership files as well as post-war investigations; similar holdings can be found in the Nazi period archive assembled by the East German State Security Service [“Stasi”] now held by the BStU; the most pertinent municipal archives to Holocaust research include the city archives of Nuremberg and Frankfurt am Main; the archives of concentration camp memorial sites (pre-eminently Buchenwald, Dachau and Sachsenhausen), other memorials (Stiftung Denkmal, Haus der Wannsee-Konferenz) and research institutions (such as the Institute of Contemporary History Munich–Berlin); the Evangelical Central Archive and the Centrum Judaicum Archiv in Berlin; and the supranational Arolsen Archives (formerly known as the International Tracing Service) in Bad Arolsen.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Germany**\r\n\r\n**C. I. In Germany**\r\n\r\nIn Germany, EHRI has identified well over 300 repositories, including a number of memorial sites and documentation centres concerning the Holocaust or, more generally, the “Third Reich” dictatorship.\r\n\r\nThe EHRI portal includes collection descriptions provided by Bundesarchiv (BArch), the Arolsen Archives and the Institut für Zeitgeschichte (IfZ). Additionally, collection descriptions from state archives, memorial site archives, university archives and the Central Archives Heidelberg have been added to the portal.\r\n\r\nThe Bundesarchiv is the main institution holding the remaining records generated by the central administrative bodies of the German Reich under National Socialist rule. As a first step, EHRI and the Bundesarchiv decided to focus on the Reich (“R”) and NSDAP (“NS”) record groups. Since almost all state administrations and Nazi Party organizations were involved either directly or indirectly with measures against Jews, no further selection of records was undertaken apart from a chronological one (i.e. collections with an end date of before and including 1932 were excluded from the import to the EHRI Portal). The Bundesarchiv also has extensive holdings on post-war dealings with the Holocaust (e.g. compensation and judicial issues), as well as personal collections and film and photo materials. Following an internal survey by Bundesarchiv, the most relevant collections in the remaining record groups, especially “Bund” and “Nachlässe und Sammlungen” (mostly administered in Koblenz), were added to the portal. Descriptions from the Bundesarchiv for materials that are accessible at the Politisches Archiv des Auswärtigen Amtes have also been included in the EHRI portal. The Bundesarchiv Agency in Ludwigsburg holds the prosecution files of the Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes [“Zentrale Stelle der Landesjustizverwaltungen zur Aufklärung nationalsozialistischer Verbrechen”]. These cover almost all violent crimes committed during the Nazi regime and the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nThe Arolsen Archives are an international center for documenting National Socialist persecution and the liberated survivors. Former victims of Nazism and their families receive information regarding their incarceration, forced labor, and if available, post-war Allied assistance. The archives provide the foundation for research and education. The Arolsen collections include original records generated by the ITS, correspondence, and copies from other institutions and archives that helped the ITS fulfill its tasks. Having exclusively records that deal with National Socialist persecution and its aftermath, almost all its collections are relevant to EHRI. In a first step, Arolsen’s archivists and historians and EHRI have integrated the following sets of collections into the portal:\r\n- Incarceration and persecution\r\n- Registrations of Persons of non-German Nationality by German State Authorities\r\n- Registrations and Files of Displaced Persons, Children and Missing Persons\r\n- Special NSDAP Organizations and Activities\r\n- Death Marches/Identification of unknown dead\r\n\r\nFor IfZ, the existing archive thesaurus was used for content selection. The IfZ Archive staff agreed on a selection of keywords identified as Holocaust-related that were used to select records from the IfZ database (public entries: http://archiv.ifz-muenchen.de) to be included in a data export for the EHRI portal. Unfortunately, the export of the full hierarchical list of each individual term connected with an individual record is not technically possible at this point, so that only the lowest level of the exported term is visible in the EHRI Portal. For record groups that are currently not reflected or not well reflected in the public IfZ database, collection descriptions were manually entered after coordination with the IfZ Archive.\r\n\r\nIn an ongoing multi-step survey of state archives, EHRI has added collection descriptions from West German state archives selected according to a review of Boberach [1991] to the portal manually, with the aim of allowing for future sustainable connections and deepened coverage. For East German archives, an ongoing review of Jersch-Wenzel / Reinke / Reinke [1996-2001] may serve as a similar, even more detailed basis in the future.\r\nIn cooperation with the archives of the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site, the collection descriptions which have been written up internally so far were published on the EHRI portal in 2019.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nDue to frontier changes after the Second World War, a number of archives relevant to Holocaust research on Germany are today located in northern and western Poland, specifically in Gorzów Wielkopolski (formerly Landsberg an der Warthe), Koszalin/Köslin, Olsztyn/Allenstein, Opole/Oppeln, Szczecin/Stettin, Wrocław/Breslau and Zielona Góra/Grünberg.",

Since then, the archive has taken on the task of securing, archiving and presenting more than 150 years of social history of working people and their organizations. In letters, documents, memoirs, photographs and everyday objects, the history of the \"ordinary people\" in Munich is documented and thus important aspects of the city's and regional history are also illuminated."

                        "history": "Das Staatsarchiv Amberg erwuchs aus dem Archiv und den Registraturen der Amberger Regierungsbehörde des bis 1621 kurpfälzischen und ab 1621/28 kurbayerischen Fürstentums der Oberen Pfalz. 1436 wird erstmals das Briefgewölbe der Amberger Kanzlei genannt, deren ältestes Urkundenverzeichnis aus der Zeit um 1457 stammt. Urkundenarchiv und Registratur der Kanzlei des bis 1499 bestehenden Teilherzogtums Pfalz-Neumarkt wurden nach Fertigstellung des neuen Amberger Kanzlei- bzw. Regierungsgebäudes im Jahre 1547 nach Amberg transferiert und mit dem Archiv und der Registratur der Amberger Kanzlei vereinigt. Seit etwa 1570 oblag die Leitung von Archiv und Registratur einem Regierungsregistrator, seit dem ausgehenden 17. Jahrhundert einem Regierungsarchivar. Die Bezeichnung „Regierungsarchiv“ für Urkundenarchiv und Regierungsregistratur ist seit dem 18. Jahrhundert geläufig.\r\n\r\nBeträchtlichen Kompetenzzuwachs brachten die verwaltungsmäßigen Unterstellungen der wittelsbachisch gewordenen Landgrafschaft Leuchtenberg im Jahre 1650 und des Fürstentums Pfalz-Sulzbach im Jahre 1791 unter die Regierung in Amberg. Mit der Bildung der „Provinz Oberpfalz“ aus den Fürstentümern Obere Pfalz und Pfalz-Sulzbach sowie der Landgrafschaft Leuchtenberg im Jahre 1799 wurde das Amberger Regierungsarchiv zum „Landesarchiv“ dieser Provinz, das, zuletzt als „kgl. bayerisches Landesarchiv der Oberen Pfalz“ bezeichnet, bis 1812 bestand.\r\n\r\nNach der bayerischen Archivorganisation von 1812 wurde das oberpfälzische Landesarchiv zu einem Archivkonservatorium herabgestuft und dem Allgemeinen Reichsarchiv in München unterstellt, an das in den folgenden Jahren umfangreiche Extraditionen erfolgten. Zwischen 1820 und 1837 war es nur noch Depotregistratur der Regensburger Kreisregierung. 1841 wurde es als Archivkonservatorium wiederbegründet und 1875 wie alle bayerischen Regionalarchive in „Kgl. Kreisarchiv“ umbenannt. Es wuchs jetzt in die Funktion eines Sprengelarchivs hinein, das für die Schriftgutabgaben aller Staatsbehörden im Regierungsbezirk zuständig war.\r\n\r\nEine feste Zuständigkeit auch für die historischen Bestände erhielt das Archiv (seit 1921 „Bayerisches Staatsarchiv Amberg“, seit 1970 „Staatsarchiv Amberg“) im Rahmen der auf der Grundlage des Provenienzprinzips insbesondere seit 1974 durchgeführten gesamtbayerischen Beständebereinigung. So wurden die nach 1812 in München zentralisierten Oberpfälzer und Leuchtenberger Bestände zwischen 1986 und 2003 sukzessive wieder nach Amberg zurückgegeben (u.a. das gesamte oberpfälzische Urkundenarchiv, die Registraturbücher der Amberger und Neumarkt-Neunburger Fürstenkanzleien, die Plansammlung der Amberger Regierung, Leuchtenberger Archivalien sowie die zum größten Teil noch aus der kurpfälzischen Zeit stammenden Bestände Oberpfälzer Klöster). Weitere Bereinigungen fanden mit den Staatsarchiven Nürnberg, Bamberg, Neuburg a. d. Donau und Landshut statt und werden mit dem Bayerischen Hauptstaatsarchiv noch durchgeführt werden (so sind weitere Zugänge aus dem im Bayerischen Hauptstaatsarchiv noch nicht abschließend analysierten Bestand „Gerichtsurkunden“ betreffend die Gerichte in der Oberpfalz zu erwarten).\r\n"

Our goal is to capture the phenomenon of exile in all its variety and to facilitate access to our holdings.\r\nThe establishment of the Exile Archive during the early post-war period was initiated by a number of émigrés and other persons, who saw it as an instrument of political enlightenment. This is another reason why we attach particular importance to the dissemination of cultural knowledge: we use exhibitions, publications and a varied events programme to communicate the complexity of exile between 1933 and 1945. We are thus making a significant contribution to a living culture of remembrance."

It was stipulated in the law that one of the archives should be located in Jutland. MPs from Aarhus, Vejle, Randers and Viborg tried to get the new archive located in  their hometown. After lengthily discussions in parliament Viborg was selected. The Viborg Municipality donated the building site and the State paid for the construction of a new archive building.  In addition, two other national archives were set up in the province: in Odense and Copenhagen. All three national archives were subdivisions under the Danish National Archives. The regional archives in Aabenraa joined in 1931.\r\n\r\nSeveral archives dating back prior to the 1920s are shared by The Danish National Archives, Aabenraa and Landesarchiv Schleswig-Holstein in the town of Schleswig (in present-day Germany). The historical development means that in many ways the archives maintained in Aabenraa differ from the other locations archives. In particular, this applies to:\r\n\r\n- Archives from the Schleswig provincial administration and local administration until 1864;\r\n- The archives of the local administration during the Prussian rule, from 1867 to 1920;\r\n- Numerous private association archives and personal papers from the national campaign  since the 1840s;\r\n- Archives relating to the German minority during the Nazi rule, the occupation, and the later judicial purge; this includes archives seized from the German minority, 1920-1945.\r\n\r\nLike the other regional archives, The Danish National Archives have numerous records of great importance to genealogists. This includes Parish Registers (the oldest one dating back to 1573), census lists, civilian birth and death bi-registers (from 1874), registers of debts, pledges and mortgages (the oldest dates back to 1669), and land registers (approximately 1880-1950).\r\n\r\nThe National Archives for Southern Jutland is part of the Danish National Archives. Geographically, it covers the area from Kongeåen to the current national border, i.e. the parts of Southern Jutland that came to Denmark at the reunification in 1920 - now Sønderjyllands amt. The National Archives receives and stores records from the local government offices and institutions in its area. In addition, you can find records from South Jutland municipalities, private institutions, associations and private individuals. The archive serves as the local archive for Aabenraa.\r\n"

Several thousand Danes were imprisoned by the German security police (Gestapo) in the Frøslev Camp.\r\n\r\nEven though the Frøslev Camp was built to avoid the deportation of Danes to concentration camps in Germany, some 1.600 Frøslev prisoners  were in fact deported to the horrors of these camps. In the days of liberation in 1945 there was an urgent need for facilities, where Danes, who had collaborated with the German occupationel power, could be interned. The Frøslev Camp was fit for this purpose. The camp was renamed Faarhus Camp and used until 1949 as an internment- and prison camp for collaborators.\r\n\r\nSince 1965, a memorial site in Frøslev - located in close vicinity to the German border - has been commemorating the former »Police Internment Camp Frøslev«. Today, the museum is in the former administration building and one of the former barracks of the camp. Both buildings are in their original state. Central themes of the exhibition are the political background for the establishment of the camp, everyday life of the prisoners and the conditions in German concentration camps, to which prisoners from Frøslev were deported."

The initiative for the museum arose from a group of private individuals who were involved in various ways in a series of exhibitions that were shown in Copenhagen in 1984 on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the Mosaic Faith Community. Several of these were involved in the Society for Danish Jewish History, which at the time was the only organizational framework for work with Danish Jewish history. The Art Association Gammel Strand showed the exhibition Within the walls. Jewish art and culture in Denmark. An exhibition about Jewish life was shown at Copenhagen City Hall You must tell your children. The special exhibition Kings and Citizens celebrated the Jubilee of the Faith Society in the United States. From this work arose the idea to establish a Jewish museum in Copenhagen, so that the public had a permanent opportunity to encounter Jewish culture in Denmark.\r\n\r\nThe museum was anchored in a commercial foundation that was founded in 1985 with Hans Weinberger as the museum's first board chairman. The museum has since had its own board and has been an independent institution. The museum was state-recognised from 1 January 2011, and the Danish Jewish cultural heritage thereby became part of Denmark's cultural heritage. The museum manages this special part of Denmark's cultural heritage, is subject to the Act on Museums in Denmark and has the Cultural Heritage Agency as the supervisory authority.\r\n\r\nSince its early beginnings in 1985, the museum has received support and help from countless individuals and foundations. In addition, the Mosaic Faith Society has made a significant donation to the museum's collection, which was transferred to the museum's ownership upon state recognition on 1 January 2011. Part of this donation can be seen in the museum's exhibition.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, the museum launched an extensive research and dissemination project on the wartime experiences of Danish Jews from 1943-1945. The special exhibition HJEM, which opened in October 2013, is the end of this project."

                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Estonia: Pre-existing research and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nEHRI identified the most important archival institutions holding Holocaust-relevant material in Estonia, relying on pre-existing academic research in the field, such as Ruth Bettina Birn: *Die Sicherheitspolizei in Estland 1941–1944. Eine Studie zur Kollaboration im Osten* (Paderborn, 2006); *Estonia 1940-1945. Reports of the Estonian International Commission for the Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity* (Tallinn, 2006); Anton Weiss-Wendt, *Murder Without Hatred: Estonians and the Holocaust* (Syracuse, 2009). EHRI also enlisted the assistance of a local specialist and, as a result, was able to identify important collections in four central archival institutions. In a second step, these collections were described, the descriptions then translated and added to the EHRI portal, where they are now accessible in English and Estonian.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Estonia’s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAn important number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created or are deposited in Estonia and can still be found in the country’s archives today. Access to them is mostly unrestricted, but records containing private or sensitive data may be withheld. For instance, personal data are protected for 30 years after a given person’s death, or, if the date of death is unknown, for 110 years after that person’s birth, or for 75 years after a given document’s creation if the dates of both birth and death are unknown. In a few cases the investigation files of the Soviet KGB or its predecessors NKGB, NKVD and others from the post-war period may be inaccessible due to both personal and sensitive data issues. That aside, researchers are allowed to take photographs from archival documents, or they can order, for a fee, digital or Xerox copies. On a practical level, a working knowledge of Estonian and/or Russian is helpful for any kind of archival research in Estonia. Most Holocaust-relevant documents, however, are in German. The local archival staff can provide help in English.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Estonia**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Estonia**\r\n\r\nHolocaust-relevant sources in Estonia are concentrated in the country’s capital, Tallinn, but divided among four archival institutions:\r\n- the National Archives of Estonia [Rahvusarhiiv]\r\n- the Estonian History Museum [Eesti Ajaloomuuseum]\r\n- the Estonian Jewish Museum [Eesti Juudi Museeum]\r\n- the Estonian Film Archives [Eesti Filmiarhiiv; now Department of the National Archives]\r\n\r\nAt the National Archives of Estonia, EHRI had identified and described a number of fonds containing a limited number of Holocaust-related records. The fonds Commander of the Security Police and SD, Estonian Security Police, Estonian SSR KGB may serve as examples of fonds that are highly important to Holocaust research on Estonia. Smaller numbers of relevant sources have been identified at the Estonian Film Archives and at the Estonian History Museum; the material stored in these institutions concerns mostly war crimes investigations. The holdings of the Estonian Jewish Museum mostly concern original materials and testimonies on Jewish life from the interwar period. Four regional departments of the National Archives, holding local documentation from the period after 1944, need to be investigated. They are, however, unlikely to hold significant quantities of Holocaust-related material.\r\n\r\nEHRI’s identification and description of these archival holdings has produced an easily accessible overview of Holocaust-relevant sources in Estonia that was previously unavailable in English.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Estonia, EHRI has identified more archival institutions holding, to various extents, collections relevant for Holocaust research. For instance, the National Archives of Latvia, State Historical Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacionālā arhīva, Latvijas Valsts vēstures arhīvs] hold the collections Wehrmacht Commander in Ostland and Commandant’s Office of the Security Police and the SD, both of which are relevant to Holocaust research on the Baltic States in general and to Estonia in particular. Furthermore, Yad Vashem, Beit Terezin and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum have collected and/or copied relevant material, e.g. on deportees to Estonia or from Estonian archives respectively.",

The inspiration for collecting came from one decoratively marbled Easter egg. The first exhibit was a Chinese opium pipe. \r\n\r\nIn 1822, Burchard put on the exhibition \"Antiquities and rarities\" at the House of the Brotherhood of the Blackheads. This event was the first of its kind in Tallinn.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, an academic society of Baltic Germans, the Estonian Literature Society (ELS, Estländische Literärische Gesellschaft), was founded in Tallinn, and one of its aims was to establish a museum “to broaden our knowledge of this country by studying its history, art, manufacturing, technology and nature”. Extensive collections were compiled over the following twenty years, which formed the basis of the Provincial Museum of the Estonian Literature Society, founded in 1864 at the house of St. Canute's Guild.\r\n\r\nIn 1911, the ELS purchased premises on Toompea at 6 Kohtu Street, where the museum's innovative activities could flourish. As the only museum in the city, it became an important focal point in Tallinn's cultural life with educational lectures and exhibitions.\r\n\r\nThe Estonian National Museum in Tartu, founded in 1909, became the most important museum in the Republic of Estonia (1918–1940), but the Museum of the ELS retained its important position through its valuable collections, with the archaeological, natural science and cultural history collections and archive continuing to thrive.\r\n\r\nMajor changes took place at the Museum of the ELS after Estonia was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940. The museum was nationalised and the History Museum of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic was established in its place. Some of the exhibits were transferred to other museums. The Estonian SSR Museum of Natural History was established using the collections of natural sciences. Overbearing ideological pressure ruined the museum in the following years. In addition to subjugating museum employees, items that were deemed harmful were eliminated, which meant destroying everything that reminded people of the Republic of Estonia. Still a majority of the main collections were preserved, some of which was saved thanks to the personal enthusiasm of the collection managers.\r\n\r\nThe museum moved to its current location at the Great Guild Hall in 1952.\r\n\r\nMaarjamäe Palace, where the History and Revolution Museum of the Estonian SSR was opened in 1987, was amalgamated with the museum in 1975.\r\n\r\nIn 1989, the museum was renamed the Estonian History Museum. Many important exhibitions that introduced the contemporary history of Estonia were held in the late 1980s and early 1990s: “Tricolour Estonia” at the Great Guild Hall (1989) and “Stalinism in Estonia” at Maarjamäe Palace (1990).\r\n"

                "summary": "EHRI explored the Finnish archives for Holocaust-relevant material by building upon existing research and a growing scholarly interest in the history of Finland during the Holocaust, which used to be accessible only with adequate language skills.

Research institutions outside of Finland, such as the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, however, do provide a selection of copied Holocaust-relevant sources on Finland and may have reference works in languages other than Finnish.\r\n\r\nTwo major relevant archival institutions, as well as their key collections on the Holocaust, have been identified: the National Archives [Kansallisarkisto] with their seven provincial branches and the Archives of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs [Ulkoasiainministeriön arkisto]. Between them, the two institutions hold eight Holocaust-relevant fonds. For a more detailed description, see the extensive report. Within the National Archives, EHRI has translated the catalogue of the Finnish Jewish Archives into English, and entered it into the local database Vakka. For details, see the extensive report.

                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Finland: Pre-existing research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nIn Finland, EHRI’s exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources was able to rely on some important pre-existing research in the field, such as Hannu Rautkallio’s *Finland and the Holocaust* (1987) or Oula Silvennnoinen’s *Geheime Waffenbrüderschaft. Die sicherheitspolizeiliche Zusammenarbeit zwischen Deutschland und Finnland* (2010), which had already made extensive use of archival sources kept both in Finland and a number of other countries. Furthermore, during EHRI’s first phase, its Finnish consortium partner, the National Archives of Finland, translated and coordinated the survey and data descriptions of Holocaust-related sources for the project. As a result, important collections in two Helsinki-based central archives were identified, and some additional material in Finnish provincial archives was discovered. These collections were described, the descriptions then translated and added to the EHRI portal, where they are now accessible in Finnish and English.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Finland’s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nA considerable number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created in Finland and can still be found in the country’s archives today. File dispersal is minimal, thanks to negligible wartime destruction of archival material and to the concentration of the country’s archival institutions in Helsinki. Access to archival sources is unrestricted, with the exception of personal data which, according to § 28 of the Population Information Act 661/2009, can only be accessed 50 years after a person’s death or, if the year of death is unknown, 100 years after that person’s birth. A working knowledge of Finnish is necessary for any kind of archival research in Finland, even though documents in other languages (sometimes English, French, German, but mostly Russian and Swedish) can also be found with the help of the local archival staff.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Finland**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Finland**\r\n\r\nIn Finland, EHRI has identified two archival institutions which hold Holocaust-relevant collections. Both are located in Helsinki:\r\n- the National Archives [Kansallisarkisto], and\r\n- the Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [Ulkoasiainministeriön arkisto]\r\n\r\nAt these two archives alone, eight Holocaust-related fonds have been identified and described in both Finnish and English. The large Finnish Jewish Archives (an important part of which consists of the Helsinki Jewish community archives) is held by the National Archives. The catalogue of the Finnish Jewish Archives was translated into English for EHRI, and entered both into the local database Vakka and into the EHRI portal. It was possible to integrate the data of this large fonds using OAI-PMH or “harvesting” (i.e. Open Archives Initiative – Protocol for Metadata Harvesting), so all levels of the description (including child items) are included.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions for the other seven fonds were done manually. As such, the National Archives also have descriptions for the large Archive of the Finnish Red Cross, and personal files compiled by the Finnish State Police (VALPO) on Finns and foreigners who were considered politically suspicious. The Holocaust-relevant sources preserved at the Archives of the Foreign Ministry, on the other hand, fit in a small number of boxes and single files, but are important nonetheless. They contain information on the “Jewish question” and Jewish refugees, but also on the war crimes investigation against the head of the Finnish State Police, Arno Anthoni. EHRI has yet to include the archives of the Finnish Ministry of Defence, which have partly been surveyed by the USHMM. Outside the Helsinki-based central archives, the Turku branch of the provincial archives holds the Archives of the Jewish Community of Turku. Six more Finnish provincial archives remain to be surveyed for Holocaust-relevant material.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nEHRI’s identification and description work on Finland was important as there are no third parties known to have carried out systematic surveys so far. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has microfilmed a limited number of sources from the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and from the Finnish Ministry of Defence records. European archival institutions, such as NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam, hold further Holocaust-relevant material on Finland as does the German Bundesarchiv.",

Records concerning Finland were transferred from Sweden to the Senate Archives which eventually began receiving material from other offices. In 1869, the Senate Archives were renamed the State Archives, and then, in 1994, they became the National Archives.The establishment of Provincial Archives was proposed at the Diet of Finland already in 1888. However, the first Provincial Archives were founded only in 1927 in Hämeenlinna. The respective Provincial Archives of Oulu and Turku were established in 1932, Mikkeli (Vyborg) in 1934, and Vaasa in 1936. Two more Provincial Archives opened in Jyväskylä in 1967 and Joensuu in 1974."

In France**\r\n\r\nEHRI has merged and updated the existing information about archives holding Holocaust-relevant materials in France. The portal currently contains over 120 repository descriptions, including the National Archives, the Departmental Archives), the archives of the Ministries of Defence, Justice, Foreign Affairs, and several Jewish archives and institutions.\r\n\r\nOne of the , if not the, most important archive on the subject in France, is the Mémorial de la Shoah in Paris. The archive and documentation centre of the Mémorial, the former Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine [CDJC, Centre of Contemporary Jewish Documentation], hold more than 30 million archival documents, including many originals bearing the signature of the heads of the Third Reich and of those responsible for the deportation of the Jews from France. These historical documents are contained in the archive collections listed below, which can be consulted in the reading room of the Documentation Centre. An archival catalogue is available online (not including data relating to the privacy of individuals mentioned). The Mémorial’s collections include German, French and other source collections.\r\n\r\nThe German sources include records from the Headquarters of the Militärbefehlshaber in Frankreich (MBF). The MBF, or German military administration in France, is divided into two major sections:\r\n1. Archives of the military command, which cover the collaboration between the occupation authorities and the Pétain government in general, the persecution of the Jews and the general reprisal policy;\r\n2. Archives of the administrative command, which include the documents dealing with the control of the occupation authorities over the French economy (interference, spoliations, in particular economic aryanisation). More specifically:\r\n  - The German Embassy in Paris, which was very actively involved in the anti-Jewish measures as can be attested by the numerous telegrams and letters sent several times per day to Berlin by Abetz and Schleier (Plenipotentiary Minister at the German embassy in Paris),\r\n  - The Gestapo in occupied France: the most important group of archives analysed is made up of the records of the Anti-Jewish division of the Gestapo in Paris. This group includes letters, telegrams, and reports on internments, deportations and other measures taken against the Jews, such as wearing the yellow star, rescinding naturalisations as well as general reprisals. There are also documents showing the pressure exerted on Italian policy in their occupied zone. This group also contains documents on the Gestapo in France preserved in the German federal archives [Bundesarchiv Koblenz]. These records give us a true picture of the structures and the activity of the Gestapo in France and in particular in the anti-Jewish division, first led by Dannecker then Rothke.\r\n\r\nThe “Archives of the Nuremberg Trials” contain part of the documentation collected for the investigations of the international military trial as well as the trials conducted by the American military court. For this major group of archives, a specific classification system is used. The main subdivisions are as follows:\r\n- NO (Nazi Organisation): this reference includes the documents from any Nazi organisation, in particular on the role of the S.S., and the WVHA (Central Office of the Economy and the Administration of the S.S.)\r\n- NOKW (Nazi \"Oberkommando der Wehrmacht\"): documents concerning the activities of the German army\r\n- NG (Nazi Government): documents illustrating the activity of the State bodies related to those of the Party\r\n- NI (Nazi Industry): documents related to industry and the financial institutions of the Third Reich\r\n\r\nThe French source collections at the Mémorial include:\r\n- The archives of the General Commissariat for Jewish Questions, or Archives du Commissariat Général aux Questions Juives (CGQJ), with more than 20,000 documents, including the trial proceedings against its leaders\r\n- The archives of Professor Montandon, an ethnologist and \"expert on racial issues\" with the CGQJ. This piecemeal collection covers the period 1924 to 1944 and primarily concerns his ethnological scientific work and his anti-Jewish propaganda activities from 1938 onwards\r\n- The archives of the Institut d'Étude des Questions Juives, a body created in 1941 under the instigation of Dannecker and of which the Mémorial holds the major portion of the surviving documents. The collection includes the correspondence of the Secretary General and describes all the activities of the Institute\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the archives of the Mémorial contain many other documents, including the Service of the Armistice, the Prefecture of the Police as well as Jewish organisations such as: l'Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants (O.S.E.); les Eclaireurs Israélites de France (E.I.F.); la Fédération des Sociétés Juives de France (F.S.J.F.); Le Conseil Représentatif des Institutions Juives de France (C.R.I.F.); l'Oeuvre de Protection de L'Enfance Juive (O.P.E.J.); and la Commission Centrale de l'Enfance (C.C.E.). Furthermore, many private collections have been donated to the Mémorial.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the EHRI project, Mémorial de la Shoah was changing its database system. Therefore data integration was not possible in the early stage of the project. Moreover, the descriptive system of the Mémorial was two-fold: a very general description of its holdings on its website and an item description for internal use. Neither of these met EHRI's specifications of top-level collection descriptions. Therefore, Mémorial de la Shoah started by describing the heart of its collections in French and English. All the available metadata have now been integrated into the EHRI portal.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Mémorial de la Shoah’s collections, EHRI provides descriptions for material at several other archival institutions in France. Namely, the National Archives, which hold administrative records created by several ministries and other central public bodies during the Vichy regime; Vichy and post-war legal proceedings; and documents donated by survivors. The material related to the General Commission on Jewish Affairs [Commissariat général aux questions juives] is particularly significant. EHRI has also described the closely-related ‘Archives of the Institute for the Study of Jewish Questions’ [Archives de l’Institut d’étude des question juives], which are held by the Defence Historical Service [Service historique de la Défense]. Moreover, EHRI provides descriptions for material at the National Archives branch for France’s overseas colonies and the National Audiovisual Institute, which possesses Holocaust-related audiovisual material. Finally, EHRI also provides links from departmental archival institutions to several United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) archival descriptions, which are available as copies at the USHMM.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nThe USHMM holds many copies of many different French archival institutions; Furthermore, the NARA (National Archives and Records Administration) in Maryland/USA possesses all the archives of the U.S. embassy in France from 1936–1941 and 1944–1953 under “Records of the Foreign Service Posts of the Department of State.” In Germany, Bundesarchiv holds a number of relevant collections, as does the Politisches Archiv des Auswärtigen Amts and the Institut für Zeitgeschichte. In Israel and Russia, Yad Vashem and the RGVA hold records and copies from various organisations and offices in France.",

                        "history": "On 12th November 1938, the French government promulgated a law that administratively interned the « indesirable foreigners.” This law permits the arrest and emprisonment of persons not for crimes, the anti-Franquists and volontaries of the International Brigades.  \r\nIn 1939, 450 000 pass the border into France. Some of them find themselves at Rivesaltes where the military camp Joffre is being rearranged to accommodate them. Starting from June-July 1940, more than 50 000 prisoners are transferred to the camps in the south of France, in the non-Occupied Zone. The conditions in the camp are precarious and this will increase on 14th January 1941 when other prisoners from other camps are transported to Rivesaltes. They are Spaniards, Jews and Gypsies. \r\n\r\nBetween August and Novembre 1942 close to 10.000 Jews will be delivered to the Reich by the Vichy Regime. At Rivesaltes, 2313 men, women and children will be deported during nine convoys. The first deportation from Rivesaltes takes place on 11th August 1942 to Drancy. By mid-September Rivesaltes becomes an interregional centre of deportation of all Jews in the non-Occupied Zone. From the 5000 interned Jews at Rivesaltes between August and Novembre 1942, more than half will be able to escape the convoys due to aide of different organisations (the Swiss Red Cross, OSE, Cimade, YMCA, Unitarian Service, etc.) but also , due to the prefect Paul Corazzi who manages to exclude a large part of the children from deportation. Since the existence of the camp, 17.500 persons have been interned at Rivesaltes, of which 53% were Spanish, 40% (foreign) Jews and 7% (French) Gypsies. On 22nd Novembre 1942, the camp becomes a military barrack for German troops.  \r\nAt the liberation of the Department of the Pyrénées-Orientales, the camp barracks will be reused as internment camp. The prisoners at this time are mainly people suspected of collaboration and black market traffickers. This occurs in September 1944 as the camp is renamed “centre of surveyed stays » (centre de séjour surveillé). In April 1945 the camp is transformed in a imprisonment camp for prisoners of war, mainly Germans but also Austrians and Italians. The number of prisoners climbs fast to more than 10.000 : the conditions deteriorate quickly and many will die in 1945. Some improvement is made in the summer of 1946 when the prisoners are used to work outside the encampment   and representation of the POW is implemented. The last prisoners will be released in 1948 and the camp will be henceforth  used again as “normal” military barracks. \r\n\r\nDuring the Algerian War, the camp is used first as military barracks for recruites waiting to be deployed overseas. Between January and May 1962, a part of the camp is transformed into a prison where prisoners of the National Liberation Front (Algerie). From September 1962, after the Algerian War ended, the Harki (muslim Algerians who served as auxiliaries in the French army during the war) are interned in the camp with their families. They are accommodated in military tents which increases the discomfort for the Harki as the 1962 winter is particularly harsh. The families are rehoused in the barracks, but the integration of the Harki into society is difficult since they were rejected from independent Algeria and thus left out by the French government. Many of them were hired in mining, steel industrie and industries in the north of France or are dispersed in different city borders especially constructed for the Harki. In December 1964, the camp of Rivesaltes will close officially, after having approximately 21 000 Harki and their families pass through. Since the departure of the Harki, the camp will be used to host soldiers from Guinea and their families (+/- 800) after the independence of Guinea in 1958. At the same time the Rivesaltes camp also hosts soldiers from French Indochina. The camp takes on one of its former roles, an administrative detention camp for expelled foreigners from 1986 to 2007. This centre will ultimately be relocated to Perpignan, since the camp at Rivesaltes  is transformed into a memorial.\r\n"

                        "history": "On 29 April 1979, the creation of the Amicale du camp de Gurs. It was a memorable day. Several former internees belonging to different groups, Spanish republicans, French undesirables, Jews from the Baden region, met in Gurs in the greatest fraternity, in order to create the new Amicale. Pedro Marco, Valentino Battistuta, Oskar Althausen and Edmond Journaud met at the entrance to the camp on 29 April 1979. Their insides were stirred by emotion and joy, and they evoked the mud, the lice, the unbearable barbed wire and... the memory of their missing companions. They expressed their satisfaction at this reunion and the need for new meetings.\r\n\r\nAround them, in a fraternal atmosphere of a rare quality, other groups of \"elders\" exchanged identical impressions. In fact, the memory of Gurs is the result of the interlocking memories of groups corresponding to the \"families\" of internees who succeeded one another in the camp.\r\n\r\nThe new Amicale du camp de Gurs is now open to the Jews, who have been involved in the memory since the 1960s, to the Spaniards, who were already present in the first association, but also to the \"undesirables\" and to the third and most represented group, the \"French politicians\".\r\n\r\nAt its first congress, held at the Gurs town hall on Saturday 21 June 1980, the Amicale had to appoint a president. The first person to come to mind was General Luis Fernandez. Interned in 1914 in Bilbao in a family of railway workers, he participated in the defence of the Spanish Republic. After being in Gurs, he was enrolled in a labour company. He then participated in the organisation of the Spanish maquis. The guerrillas carried out many brilliant actions under the command of their \"general\" and liberated Toulouse. Approved as a colonel in the French Army, he received the rank of Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur in 1946 before going underground in 1950, because the Spanish Communist Party was banned in France. Continuing his activities, he was arrested in 1960 and deported to Poland. A serious accident allowed his return to France in 1963. His commitments made him a high-profile personality who, moreover, kept a very precise memory of what he had experienced, particularly in the Gurs camp. He would therefore be an ideal president for the Amicale, but he has a poor command of the French language. General Fernandez therefore proposed this function to several former internees present and it was finally Léon Bérody who accepted the post.\r\n\r\nRead more on the history of the Amicale du camp de Gurs [here](https://campgurs.com/lamicale/lhistoire-de-lamicale/le-temps-des-t%C3%A9moins-1975-1980/)."

Once all of France as occupied, the Gestapo used it as a prison, interrogation centre and internment camp for those waiting for transfer to concentration camps from January 1943 to 24 August  1944. It is estimated that over 10,000 men, women and children were imprisoned in Montluc, and over 900 of them were executed within it. \r\n\r\nIn mid-August 1944, prisoners from Montluc were taken to Bron Airfield where 109 of them, including 72 Jews, were killed in what would become known as Le Charnier de Bron (\"The Charnel house of Bron\").\r\n\r\nMontluc was liberated on 24 August 1944 by FFI troops, when resistance leader Colonel Köenig, profiting from the chaos reigning in Lyon at the time, entered the prison in a stolen German Army car disguised as a Gestapo officer and persuaded the Commandant to free the prisoners, saying that the order had come from the Gestapo Commander in Lyon, Klaus Barbie.\r\n\r\nIn 1947, Montluc became a civil prison once again, finally closing in 1997, though the female maison d'arrêt was not closed until May 2009."

This evolution of different prisoners culminated in the deportation of 2000 children, women and men from the Milles camp to the Drancy and Rivesaltes camps to finally Auschwitz in August and September 1942.\r\n\r\nFirst period: The Third Republic\r\nSeptember 1939 - June 1940\r\nInternment camp for \"enemy subjects\"\r\n\r\nSecond period: The Vichy regime\r\nJuly 1940-July 1942\r\nTransit and internment camp for \"undesirables\"\r\n\r\nFinal period: Vichy - \"The final solution\"\r\nAugust 1942 - September 1942\r\nJews deported to Auschwitz via Drancy\r\n• 10,000 people of 38 nationalities interned here\r\n• Over 2,000 Jews deported to Auschwitz\r\n\r\nThe \"camp of artists\"\r\nOne distinguishing feature of the Camp des Milles is the number and diversity of artworks produced by the interned.\r\nMore than 400 pieces were created here, some of which are on display at the camp today. This proliferation of art can be explained by the many artists and intellectuals (Max Ernst, Hans Bellmer, Lion Feuchtwanger and others) who channeled their creativity to resist\r\nthe persecution and dehumanisation to which the interned were subjected."

Some deportees from the camp annexes had their sufferings prolonged in the spring of 1945 on the \"Death Marches\".\r\n\r\nFrom 1941 to 1945, the KL-Natzweiler was one of the most murderous camps of the Nazi system.

They hid the Jews in private homes, on farms in the area, as well as in public institutions. Whenever the Nazi patrols came searching, the Jews were hidden in the mountainous countryside.\r\n\r\nIn 1981 the entire town was awarded an honorary degree by Haverford College in Pennsylvania in recognition of its humanitarian efforts. In 1982, documentary filmmaker Pierre Sauvage—who was born and sheltered in Le Chambon—returned there to film Weapons of the Spirit (1989). In 1990, for their humanitarianism and bravery under extreme danger, the entire town was recognized as \"Righteous Among the Nations\". A small garden and plaque on the grounds of the Yad Vashem memorial to the Holocaust in Israel was dedicated to the people of Chambon-sur-Lignon. In 2004 French President Jacques Chirac officially recognized the heroism of the town. The Pont-de-Mars Castle in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.

                        "name": "Archives départementales des Vosges",
                        "history": "Created during the French Revolution by the law of 5 brumaire an V (26 October 1796), the departmental archives have the task of collecting, classifying, preserving and communicating the written heritage of the department: administrative, family and business archives, and iconographic documents. \r\nThe creation of the Departmental Archives was the result of the political will to centralise the Nation's archives at the departmental level, which was already evident in the decree of 20 April 1790. In the Vosges, as in many other departments, the archives were initially kept in the premises of the Prefecture: in the former Jesuit college, now the Ecole du Centre, and then in the premises of the current Prefecture built in 1828. In 1808, a fire spared the archives, but they were nevertheless downgraded when they were temporarily evacuated. In 1841, the filing system was improved, even though it did not follow the 1817 standards, by derogation of the Minister of the Interior. \r\nSuccessive archivists endeavoured to complete, classify and preserve the collections in the most suitable premises possible. The oldest document preserved in the Vosges is the charter of Adalberon II, bishop of Metz and brother of Thierry I, Duke of Lotharingia, dating from 985. This diploma from the abbey of Senones, listed as 2 H 1, confirms the abbey's possession of the church of Vacqueville (today in Meurthe-et-Moselle) and its dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe departmental archives then had to suffer from conflicts. The Franco-Prussian war of 1870-1871 caused administrative complications with the fluctuation of the border, leading to the extraction of documents from the archives by the German authorities, which was only resolved after the First World War. The First World War led to the removal of 70 boxes of the most valuable archives to Montpellier. Many documents were destroyed in the communes following the occupations. The Second World War had the same effects: archives were moved and destroyed in the communes. In particular, the archives of the tribunal de grande instance of Saint-Dié, two departments of the Prefecture, the Inspection académique, and most of the war damage files from the First World War disappeared.\r\n\r\nFor the departmental archives of the Vosges, the post-war period was a time of blossoming. The collection continued actively, so much so that the premises of the Prefecture, despite renovations, had to be supplemented by an annex in the former chapel of the Franciscans in Épinal, and then by another in Golbey. From the mid-1970s onwards, the number of staff increased. Even before the decentralisation, the General Council undertook the creation of a new building in La Voivre. Work began in 1986 and the new home of the Departmental Archives opened its doors on 18 April 1988. This building was used to store the 14 linear kilometres of collections that existed at the time. Decentralisation accelerated the growth of the team, which reached 18 people in 1991 and 27 by 2011."

                        "history": "Like all departmental archives, the Indre departmental archives originated during the revolution, when the papers of the suppressed institutions and the titles of the national domains were collected in the district capitals and then, from the year V, in the departmental capital.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, the archives were kept in the treasury room of the Château-Raoul (in the old dungeon destroyed in 1824), and then moved to the attic of this building, where they were kept in the uncomfortable conditions of a fire or flood.\r\n\r\nIn 1894, they were moved to the building of the former printer Migné, at 32 rue de la Vieille Prison, to which the departmental architect Henry Dauvergne had added a two-storey warehouse. Few changes were made until the directorate of Xavier du Boisrouvray (1953-1966), who emptied the depot and fitted it out with three levels and an attic with concrete floors supported by metal shelving with supporting posts.\r\n\r\nIn 1970, when the new prefecture was built, two rooms in the basement (about fifty metres from the main warehouse) allowed for a significant increase in shelving. However, the small size of the premises used by the public (the former salon of the Hôtel Migné, now a reading room) and the inconvenience of the offices (converted flats or attic) led to the search for a new location.\r\n\r\nSince October 2003, the departmental archives have been transferred to the former girls' teacher training school. This building, built in 1888-1889 by Henry Dauvergne, was restored and enlarged in 2000-2002 by the firm SAREA (Mr. Alain Sarfati) and Architectes et Associés de Châteauroux (Mr. Jean-Paul Broquet). It has a 48-seat reading room (some of which can be used to consult digitised collections), exhibition, conference and school rooms, and approximately 20 linear kilometres of shelving."

                        "history": "In changing political institutions and administrative districts, the French Revolution was concerned with the preservation of its archives and those of the abolished institutions. Sorting officers were charged with sorting out useful state documents, preserving historical archives and destroying all monarchical and feudal vestiges. They often confused the function of Paris, the capital of France, with that of chief town of the Seine department, by directing to the National Archives (created in 1790) documents that would naturally have belonged in the Archives of the Seine, created by the law of 5 Brumaire An V (26 October 1796).\r\n\r\nFrom 1803, the Archives de la Seine were housed in the Hôtel de Ville, then in 1860, in an annex on Avenue Victoria. The fires that ravaged Paris at the end of the Commune in May 1871 had disastrous consequences for the Parisian archives: in addition to parish records, civil status registers, documents resulting from the activities of Parisian guilds, religious communities, and parish factories, as well as the documents that existed in the courthouse, which was also burned down, were all reduced to ashes. From 1878 onwards, the archives of the Seine moved to Quai Henri IV. Following the law of 10 July 1964 on the reorganisation of the Paris region, the Seine department was abolished. There followed a new distribution (devolution) of the archives from the former prefecture of the Seine to the newly created Archives départementales de la petite couronne.\r\nIn order to be able to continue the statutory collection of the archives of the administrations located on the territory of Paris, several annexes to the one on the Quai Henri IV coexisted in the Paris region. A first annex was inaugurated in Villemoisson-sur-Orge in 1985 and the current Archives de Paris building, designed by the architects Henri and Bruno Gaudin, located at the Porte des Lilas, was inaugurated in 1990. A second annex in Seine-Saint-Denis, opened in 2018, further increases storage capacity.\r\n\r\nUntil 1975, the status of Paris was largely inspired by the law of 28 Pluviôse Year VIII (17 February 1800), which established a prefect for administration and a prefect for the police. It is only since 1975 that the prefect no longer has any municipal functions. Because of this dual status (city and department), the Archives of the Seine and then of Paris are both municipal and departmental archives, which can be considered the leading French territorial archive service: they conserve nearly 76 linear kilometres of documents, welcome more than 7,000 researchers in 15,000 working sessions and communicate approximately 45,000 documents each year."

As of 1 January 1986, they became a departmental responsibility, placed under the full authority of the president of the general council, which became the departmental council in 2015.\r\n\r\nThe role of the Departmental Archives developed during the 19th and 20th centuries. Initially made up of the files of the administrations, jurisdictions and establishments of the Ancien Régime that were nationalised, they were extended to the archives of the administrations established in the department, to the archives of notaries, communes, hospitals, as well as to private archives...\r\n\r\nAmong the Ancien Régime documents, we deplore the disappearance of a large part of the archives of the former bishopric of Cahors, following a dispute over their fate, which arose around 1805 between Prefect Bailly, the first prefect of the Lot (March 1800 - December 1813), and Bishop Cousin de Grainville (bishop of Cahors from 1802 to 1828). There is also evidence of the \"burning\" of documents (feudal titles, old books, parchments, etc.) in 1792 and 1793."

Despite an attempt in 1793 to bring them together in a single repository, the colony's archives went through many vicissitudes before being placed under the responsibility of the colonial controller by the organic order of 21 August 1825. The archives were then transferred for more than a century to a building of the colonial control, rue de l'intendance (today rue Amiral Lacaze).\r\n\r\nOn 5 September 1861, the General Council re-established the post of colonial archivist, entrusted to a retired assistant commissioner of the navy, Marcel Voïart. Filing and sorting were carried out until the post was abolished in 1906, leaving the archives abandoned. In 1919, the curator of the Léon Dierx museum, Adrien Merlo, was appointed curator-archivist. After his death, the functions of \"archivist-curator of the Léon Dierx museum, colonial librarian\" were combined in the person of Eugène Massinot.\r\n\r\nTo cope with the clutter of the premises, Governor Truitard decided to build a new building, at the corner of Rue Jean Châtel and Rue Roland Garros, to house the colonial archives and library. The transfer of the archives took place in 1939 in a state of great confusion. \r\n\r\nWith the departmentalization, the metropolitan legislation on departmental and communal archives was extended to the overseas departments by decree of 28 June 1948. The first departmental archivist, Yves Pérotin, took up his post in 1952. The saturation of the premises led to the multiplication of annexes, before a new building was delivered in 1971, on rue Hippolyte Foucque in Le Chaudron.\r\n\r\nThe Departmental Archives are now housed in Champ-Fleuri (4 rue Marcel Pagnol - Sainte-Clotilde) in a building designed by architects Pierre Noailly and Alain Bocquée, which was inaugurated in 2001. Since the decentralisation laws of 1986, the Departmental Archives have been under the supervision of the General Council, now the Departmental Council. \r\n\r\nHoused on the Victoire site, the General Council's intermediate archives service was attached to them in 2009; since then they have extended their competences to the Department's intermediate archives.\r\n\r\nOn 13 July 2015, the Departmental Archives of Reunion Island took the name of Sudel Fuma, in memory of the politician, academic and historian who died the previous year."

Therefore, in 1892, the Archives were moved to the Hôtel des Monneyroux, the current headquarters of the Conseil Général. However, this historic building was not well suited to the growing number of 20th century archives, so in 1959 the Archives were moved to a building in the rue de l'ancienne mairie, which combined an 18th century hotel with purpose-built archive storage facilities. The latter were also slowly saturated by the influx of archives, and so the question of moving arose thirty years later.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, the Conseil Général de la Creuse bought the former offices and warehouses of the Coopérateurs de la Creuse to install the Archives Départementales.

In the 19th century, the town of Belfort was the administrative centre of an arrondissement in the Haut-Rhin département. For this reason, most of the documents produced were transferred in 1868 to the Archives départementales du Haut-Rhin (A.D.H.R.) in Colmar.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871 put an end to the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-1871 and changed the destiny of Belfort. Belfort and 105 surrounding communes escaped annexation to the German Reich and remained French, becoming ‘the remaining French part of the Haut-Rhin’. \r\n\r\nAdministrative departments, including the Departmental Archives, were set up and moved to Belfort, in the sub-prefecture building on Grande Rue. They were placed under the authority of a ‘provisional administrator acting as prefect’. \r\n\r\nIn 1903, the department took up residence in the basement of the new prefecture building, built for the administration in the heart of the new district. It already held 700 linear metres of documents. \r\n\r\nOn 11 March 1922, after a long period of prevarication over the possibility of reintegrating the 106 communes into the Haut-Rhin department, which had been French again since 1918, the Territoire de Belfort was officially created. The provisional administrator, Mr Maisonobe (former curator of the Lozère departmental archives) was appointed prefect of the department.\r\n\r\nThe Departmental Archives were not yet autonomous, as they remained under the supervision of the curator of the Haute-Saône Archives from 1923 to 1945. The department tried to organise itself and began publishing its first inventories.  \r\n\r\nAfter the Second World War, the management of the Archives de France decided to create full-time posts. A sub-archivist was appointed in Belfort in 1946, followed in 1956 by the first curator, the director. In 1968, Vauban Tower 46 was refurbished, enabling the department to be extended. In 1982, the current building came into use, with storage capacity increased to 14 linear kilometres of documents. "

Very early on, the Velay region was concerned with the classification and conservation of archives, both in the royal administration and among the ecclesiastics: in 1485, Canon Sigaud is mentioned as being the custodian of the archives of the cathedral chapter.\r\nThe first building used for the conservation of the Haute-Loire Archives was the former Capuchin convent purchased by the departmental administration in 1791. Arcis, the first departmental archivist, was appointed that same year. Then came Auguste Aymard, who was responsible for the creation of the repository from 1840 onwards and for the first filing of archives.\r\n\r\nAfter having passed through several premises, the Departmental Archives moved in 1988 to a new building designed by the architects V. Besançon and the Arsène brothers. Besançon and the Arsène Henry brothers. These new premises offer better working conditions for both the public (reading room, inventories and exhibitions) and the staff.\r\nDependent on the State until the decentralisation laws of 1982, the Departmental Archives became a department of the Department under the scientific and technical control of the Inter-ministerial Service of the Archives of France (Ministry of Culture)."

Characteristics of the British archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe National Archives in London are the official archives for the UK Government, storing its records and those of the United Kingdom’s central courts. The Public Records Act (1958) places responsibility for the management of public records on departments. Additional repositories of The National Archives also exist on the Channel Islands, Jersey and Guernsey. In addition to The National archives, there are many private archive initiatives.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on the United Kingdom**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In the United Kingdom**\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom, EHRI has identified over 20 repositories, and is able to provide over hundreds of archival descriptions from several institutions. The Wiener Holocaust Library is the oldest Holocaust memorial institution in the world. Founded as the Jewish Central Information Office in 1933 by Dr Alfred Wiener, the Library has been based in London since 1939 and holds extensive collections including published and unpublished works, eyewitness accounts, photographs and press cuttings.\r\n\r\nHolocaust-related material, however, is held by many other archival institutions, such as the Island Archives in Guernsey, which hold extensive collections on the German occupation of Guernsey (1940-1945), including those of the Feldkommandantur and the local civil administration, or Jersey Archives, which stores registration cards and significant records of all aspects from the German occupation. In The National Archives, there are very important documents relating to the Second World War and the Holocaust among the British government and military records. The most popular are within departments War Office (WO), Home Office (HO), Prime Minister’s Office Records (PREM) and Foreign Office (FO). The National Archives also holds records of war crimes and criminals (both alleged and proved) from 1939–1945 as well as copies of documents captured by the Western Allied forces from enemy powers at the end of the Second World War. Furthermore, the Imperial War Museum in London has collections ranging from film and oral history to works of art and large objects, but also to personal letters and diaries. The Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum as well as the Polish Underground Movement Study Trust hold important Holocaust-related material generated by the Polish government-in-exile as well as the Polish underground in occupied Poland. The collections in the Sikorski Institute are now regarded as holding the most important Polish émigré collections in the world. An extensive description of the Institute and its holdings can be found in Alina Skibińska’s archival guide, which has been revised and translated into English as part of EHRI’s efforts to make Holocaust-relevant sources linked to Poland easier to locate.\r\n\r\nFinally, archives in the UK also house many sources about the Holocaust in other countries, mainly concerning British intelligence on what was happening in occupied Europe as well as the reactions of the governments-in-exile and resistance movements located in the UK.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of the United Kingdom, the United State Memorial Museum, Yad Vashem hold collections that are relevant to Holocaust research on the United Kingdom.",

The Life galleries represent natural history, human history and prehistory. The Expression galleries include the fine art collections. A significant part of the paintings collection comes from the bequest of Archibald McLellan. The important collection of French 19th century paintings includes works by Monet, Gauguin and Renoir. Further highlights are Rembrandt’s ‘Man in Armour’, ‘Christ and the Adulteress’ by Titian and Salvador Dali’s ‘Christ of St John of the Cross’.

Recognizing a gap in their Holocaust education, the Smith family felt compelled to ensure the Holocaust was taught comprehensively in the UK. After years of fundraising and effort, the Centre, affectionately known as Beth Shalom, was established as the only national museum in the UK dedicated to Holocaust education. It features two permanent exhibitions, memorial gardens, and the unique exhibit \"The Journey\" for younger children.\r\n\r\nThe Centre's relationship with the Pears family and the Pears Foundation has been pivotal, with significant support from Sir Trevor Pears CMG, whom the Smith brothers consider a \"third brother.\"\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in response to global genocides, the Smith brothers founded the Aegis Trust in 2000, which operates the Kigali Memorial Centre in Rwanda and promotes peace education across Africa. The Kigali Memorial Centre, inspired by the National Holocaust Centre, has hosted numerous international dignitaries and continues to be a significant site for genocide remembrance and education."

Arriving in the Lake District was described by the children as being in \"Paradise,\" a stark contrast to their experiences in Nazi concentration camps and ghettos. The Lake District Holocaust Project, established in 2013 after years of research and education, documented these events through exhibitions, oral histories, and multimedia installations.\r\n\r\nA touring exhibition, \"Auschwitz to Ambleside,\" traveled through the Lakes area in 2008-2009, and a permanent exhibition was set up in Windermere Library in 2010, which expanded in 2013 due to its success. The exhibition attracts visitors worldwide, including from the US, Canada, Germany, and Israel, and involves artists, writers, musicians, academics, teachers, and schoolchildren.\r\n\r\nThe children, liberated from the Theresienstadt ghetto near Prague, were brought to the UK in August 1945. They were transported to the Lake District by aircraft, arriving at Crosby on Eden airfield. Initially housed at the Calgarth Estate, a wartime housing scheme, the children were provided with individual rooms, clean linen, and opportunities for education and recreation. Over six months, they were gradually moved to homes across the UK.\r\n\r\nPhotographs taken by German-born photographer Kurt Hutton during the children's stay at Calgarth Estate were discovered in 2009, many of which feature the Windermere Children. These images, some unpublished, capture the children's early experiences of recovery and adaptation to their new lives in the UK."

Against a backdrop of devastating conflicts in Bosnia and Rwanda, where genocide was happening on an appalling scale, a small group of social workers met in the offices of the Leeds Jewish Welfare Board. This was for a routine conversation about their weekly meetings with clients.\r\n\r\nHowever, the conversation soon focused other matters and, apropos of nothing, it suddenly became apparent that a few people in the room shared something remarkable in common.\r\n\r\nThey were Holocaust survivors.\r\n\r\nAnd what became even more incredible was that, after a little research, they found others in Leeds who were also survivors.\r\n\r\n“It was a big moment,” explains Barbara Cline, who has worked for over 40-years at the Leeds Jewish Welfare Board. “They had been in Britain for 50-years and had never spoken about their experiences. This burden had been bottled up for so long and it was incredibly liberating to finally talk about it with people who could relate and understand.”\r\n\r\nThe foundations for a new mutual support group were established that day and, soon after, meetings were established where survivors came to share their experiences over tea and coffee. In 1996, the HSFA was formally established, and it wasn’t long before they were venturing out into schools, and other organisations to do talks about the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nWhat had started from conversations would go on to develop into a powerful, community-led educational organisation telling a global history through local stories from the North of England.\r\n\r\nAt every stage of our development, we continually return to the core values of bearing witness to the truth and showing solidarity with survivors that shone so brightly on that day in 1995."

                        "history": "HG Adler was born into a Jewish family in Prague in 1910 and studied musicology, literature and philosophy at Charles University, gaining his doctorate there in 1935. He was prevented from pursuing an academic career by the rise of the Nazis in Germany and in 1941 was sent to work at a labour camp in Bohemia, before being deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp with his first wife, Gertrud, and her family.\r\n\r\nEven while still in the ghetto, Adler was able to give artistic expression to his experiences; altogether, he wrote over a hundred poems in Theresienstadt, as well as systematically collecting material for his later studies. Closely involved in the cultural life of the ghetto, Adler was instrumental in saving Viktor Ullman’s Theresienstadt opera Der Kaiser von Atlantis; his own works owe their preservation to Rabbi Leo Baeck, who looked after them when Adler was finally deported to the East. After more than two years confined in the Nazis’ “model ghetto”, the Adlers were transported to Auschwitz on 12 October 1944. On the selection ramp Adler was ordered to an outlying work camp; his wife refused to desert her mother, accompanying her to the gas chamber so that she should not die alone.\r\n\r\nOn liberation, Adler returned to Prague in June 1945, finding work as a tutor and helping to develop the Jewish Museum before emigrating to London in 1947, where he lived in exile until his death in 1988. He married Bettina Gross in England and renewed friendships with writers and artists from pre-war Prague, many also living in exile. Adler was one of the last representatives of the Prague school of German literature, following in the traditions of Franz Kafka and Rainer Maria Rilke. Although he saw himself primarily as a poet, he wrote numerous plays and essays, as well as a number of novels including Eine Reise (1962) and Panorama (1968). He published widely in the fields of literature, sociology, religion and philosophy, yet it is as a witness and historian of the Holocaust that he is best known.\r\n\r\nIt was important to Adler to record what he had witnessed in the ghettos and camps of the Second World War and he became one of the first writers to describe and analyse the Nazi persecution of the Jews. His comprehensive study of the Theresienstadt ghetto, Theresienstadt 1941-1945: das Antlitz einer Zwangsgemeinschaft, was completed in 1948 and first published in 1955. It remains one of the most detailed and thorough studies of the organisation, history and sociology of a single concentration camp, and quickly established Adler’s reputation as a founder of Holocaust scholarship. Despite taking seven years to find a publisher, Theresienstadt was met with immediate success when finally released and the book’s scholarly impartiality was held in such high regard in Germany that it was accepted by the courts as legal evidence of the “Final Solution\"."

                        "name": "World ORT Archive",
                        "history": "ORT was founded in St Petersburg, Tsarist Russia, in 1880 to provide employable skills for Russia’s impoverished Jews. The organization’s founding fathers were Nikolai Bakst, Baron Horace Gunzburg and Samuel Poliakov.\r\nTogether with several influential members of the St Petersburg Jewish community they obtained permission to form ORT, a “charitable fund for a useful purpose”, in honor of the Tsar’s 25th anniversary. The name “ORT” was coined from the acronym of the Russian words “Obshestvo Remeslennogo i zemledelcheskogo Truda”, meaning “The Society for Trades and Agricultural Labour”.\r\nORT distributed funds to Jewish schools for handicraft and agricultural training and provided grants or loans to artisans and farmers. In the early 1900s the organization began to sponsor cooperative ventures, to support training programs in Jewish schools and to establish its own vocational schools.\r\nDuring and after the First World War, ORT’s workshops, credit and labour offices saved thousands from starvation and unemployment. In 1921 the ORT Union (today’s World ORT) was created to coordinate fundraising efforts and to oversee ORT’s growing activities in Europe and elsewhere.\r\nThrough the interwar years ORT supported Jewish farmers with equipment, loans and training while graduates of ORT’s technical schools gained employment as technicians and engineers. In the 1930s ORT courses helped Jewish refugees fleeing the rise of Hitler to prepare for life in other countries.\r\nIn the Soviet Union, ORT worked with the authorities to establish industries and supply materials and machinery but was forced to close down its operations in 1938.\r\n\r\nThe movement of Jewish refugees led to the development of new ORT programs beyond Europe, mainly in South America. In Europe, during the Holocaust, ORT became a “Passport to Life” as our trainees in ghettos received extra food rations and were selected for labour details. In many cases, this meant the difference between life and death.\r\n\r\nAfter the war ORT trained tens of thousands of survivors and displaced persons from Jewish communities throughout Europe. ORT graduates contributed to the building of the early Jewish community of Palestine and, after the founding of the State of Israel, ORT became a key feature in the country’s education system.\r\nORT also turned its attention to the needs of “forgotten” Jewish communities in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Iran.\r\nIn 1960 ORT was asked by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to undertake technical training programs in Africa. Seeing this as an integral part of its mission, ORT took up the challenge and began a new phase of humanitarian activities outside the international Jewish community while at the same time expanding its work with Jewish communities in France, Latin America, North Africa, the Middle East and India.\r\nIn Ethiopia, ORT received permission to operate in the Gondar province in 1977. It brought crafts, vocational skills, modern agricultural methods, medical help and general and Jewish education to these remote areas.\r\nIn the 1990s ORT returned to Russia, the country of its birth, followed by other countries in the former Soviet Union (FSU) and Eastern Europe.\r\nIn addition to its existing Jewish day schools in Latin America and elsewhere, ORT established day schools in the major Jewish communities in the FSU as well as vocational training centers for women in rural FSU communities.\r\nIn 2007 ORT founded the World ORT Kadima Mada educational network in Israel. Today, ORT is active worldwide and provides skills training and self-help projects.\r\n\r\nRead more on ORT's history [here](https://ortarchive.ort.org/establishment/founders-of-ort)."

Enriqueta was closely involved in the design and construction of the building, and in the simultaneous development of the collections.\r\n\r\nIn particular, she was personally responsible for purchasing the two foundational collections: the incomparable collection of printed books assembled by the 2nd earl Spencer (which she bought for £210,000 in 1892) and the earl of Crawford’s collection of manuscripts (costing £155,000 in 1901).\r\n\r\nBoth The John Rylands Library and Victoria University of Manchester Library had built up outstanding Special Collections. They merged in 1972.\r\n\r\nThe John Rylands Research Institute was created in 2013. Since its inception, the Institute has gained both national and international recognition.\r\n\r\nIt has been involved in attracting grants to support research on the collections from funders including the Arts and Humanities Research Council, Leverhulme Trust, British Academy and Marie Curie Foundation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, generous philanthropic donations from Amin Amiri, David Shreeve, The Soudavar Memorial Foundation and Mark Younger, amongst others, have helped to support a range of important projects.\r\n\r\nIn March 2021 The John Rylands Research Institute and the University’s iconic John Rylands Library forged an exciting new partnership as the John Rylands Research Institute and Library. The renaming signalled much closer collaboration between researchers and Library staff, in order to promote more effectively world-class research and public engagement with research, based on the remarkable special collections of The University of Manchester Library.\r\n"

                        "name": "Association of Jewish Refugees, Serving Holocaust Refugees and Survivors Nationwide",
                        "history": "Founded in London in summer 1941, The Association of Jewish Refugees (AJR) is one of the most important organisations established anywhere in the world by the Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria. As it announced at the outset, it aimed at representing all those Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria for whom Judaism is a determining factor in their outlook on life. It thereby differentiated itself from the other organisations claiming to represent the refugees from Nazism in Britain, principally the Free German League of Culture and the Austrian Centre, which had been established by politically conscious refugees, with the intention of persuading their members to return after the war to Germany and Austria respectively.\r\n\r\nThe AJR, by contrast, defined itself as a Jewish self-help organisation. Its founding executive consisted of Orthodox Jews, Liberal Jews and Zionists, in an attempt to appeal as widely as possible to the Jewish refugees in Britain its membership, however, would soon reflect the preponderance of secularised, assimilated Jews among those who had fled to Britain after 1933. Under its long-serving General Secretary, Werner Rosenstock (1941-82), the AJR settled in premises in the Finchley Road area of Hampstead, north-west London, where it was to remain until the early years of the twenty-first century.\r\n\r\nThe AJR began at once to campaign on behalf of its membership, then still classed as ‘enemy aliens’ formerly of German nationality. It sought to bring home to the British public that its members supported the war effort against Germany unconditionally; accordingly, it demanded the removal of the restrictions placed on them as ‘enemy aliens’, which prevented them from contributing to the Allied cause to the best of their ability. As the war neared its end, the AJR campaigned against attempts to repatriate the refugees against their will to their countries of origin. It also pressed for the refugees to be permitted to apply for British citizenship, thus enabling them to settle securely in their adopted homeland. Many thousands of Jewish refugees were to become British by naturalisation in the later 1940s, laying the foundation for a flourishing community that combined its German-Jewish social culture with a strong sense of integration into British society. Since 1946, the AJR has published its monthly journal, AJR Information, which was renamed AJR Journal in 2000.\r\n\r\nThe AJR also provided important services to its members. One of its first appointments was a trained social worker, who offered advice and support to refugees suffering from the emotional dislocation of forced emigration, from the difficulties of adapting to life in a foreign country, from problems of employment and accommodation, and not least from the burden of anxiety about family members left behind in Nazi-controlled areas. After the war, the AJR involved itself in the struggle to secure restitution for the Jewish refugees for the losses they had suffered under Nazi persecution. The campaign for Wiedergutmachung was to remain a central concern for the AJR for many decades.\r\n\r\nAs its membership aged, the AJR largely abandoned political campaigning and concentrated on providing social services for its members; most notably, it cooperated in the running of old age homes for elderly and incapacitated refugees. Over many years, the AJR has established a proud record of serving its membership, which now includes Holocaust survivors from across Europe."

                        "history": "The Wiener Holocaust Library traces its roots back to Germany in the 1920s. Dr Alfred Wiener, a German Jew, having fought in WWI, returned to Germany in 1919 and was horrified at the surge of right-wing antisemitism, which blamed Jews for the defeat. Dr Wiener worked with the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith to combat antisemitism, writing, lobbying and speaking publicly. From 1925 (the year Hitler published Mein Kampf) he perceived a greater threat from the Nazi Party than any other antisemitic group or party. Under his influence an archive was started just to collect information about the Nazis, which formed the basis of campaigns to undermine their activities.Dr Wiener and his family fled Germany in 1933 and settled in Amsterdam. Dr Wiener's archive is believed to have been destroyed. Later that year he set up the Central Jewish Information Office at the request of the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Anglo-Jewish Association. The JCIO essentially continued the work of the earlier archive. Following the November Pogrom of 1938, Wiener prepared to bring his collection to the UK. It arrived the following summer and is believed to have opened on the day the Nazis invaded Poland.Throughout the War the JCIO served the British Government as it fought the Nazi regime. Increasingly the collection was referred to as‘Dr Wiener's Library' and eventually this led to its renaming. Post-war, the Library assisted the prosecutors at the Nuremberg Trial, amassed early survivor testimony and helped to shape the emerging academic study of the Holocaust."

                        "name": "Department for Business Innovation and Skills, \"Enemy Property\"",
                        "history": "Under wartime legislation, the UK Government confiscated assets in British territory owned by residents of enemy countries. This took under the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act 1939 (c89), an Act intended to prohibit commercial or financial dealings with the enemy, and to preserve enemy assets in the UK in order to prevent the enemy from benefiting from them. The enemy countries included Nazi Germany and its allies, as well as countries under Nazi occupation. After the war, the assets of the occupied countries were released from British Government control, but the assets of the 'belligerent' countries were distributed to British creditors whose assets had been confiscated by the enemy countries. An exception was made for victims of Nazi persecution and soon after the war; Nazi victims or their heirs could claim the return of their assets.\r\n\r\nIn Spring 1997, following public concern that there were still many assets belonging to victims that had not been returned, the British Government conducted research into the history of the administration of Enemy Property. Searches were made in the surviving records in the TWE (Trading With the Enemy) series, originally created by the Treasury and the Board of Trade. One result of this research was the compilation of a database of the assets seized from residents of belligerent enemy countries.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government saw the situation as an injustice that had to be addressed and, in June 1998, commissioned Lord Archer of Sandwell to advise on the design of a suitable compensation scheme. In December 1998, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced the compensation scheme administered by an independent Enemy Property Compensation Advisory Panel. Shortly after its formation, this Panel was known as the Enemy Property Claims Assessment Panel (EPCAP).\r\n\r\nEPCAP launched the Enemy Property Payments Scheme in April 1999 under the Chairmanship of Lord Archer of Sandwell, sitting with two teams of assessors who were expert in finance and ethnic minority issues. The initial period for submission of claims ended on 30th September 1999. Each claim was then considered by EPCAP. Claims could be made in respect of any property in the UK confiscated by Her Majesty's Government under British legislation on enemy property or trading with the enemy if not already returned, and compensation not already been paid to cover its full value. The Government undertook to pay compensation on the basis of wartime values increased by the change in the retail prices index. Compensation was to be paid to victims of Nazi persecution who owned such property when it was confiscated, and to others who could demonstrate that they were likely to have been the beneficial owner of such property if it had not been confiscated, if they or the original owner suffered Nazi persecution.\r\n\r\nOn 8th July 2004, the Minister Patricia Hewitt announced the closure of the Enemy Property Payment Scheme. At that time, the Panel reported that 220,000 separate items were confiscated and either sold or returned to the original owners. They had received a total of 1,121 claims, of which 377 were successful. Payments made under the Scheme amounted to £16.2 million. There remained but 22 cases outstanding; and only one item (a gilt bracelet and diamond tie-pin) unclaimed. Following continued interest in the scheme it became clear that its formal closure would have to be deferred and claims will still be considered in exceptional circumstances."

                        "history": "The underlying reason for the creation of the Gen. Sikorski Polish Institute in London was the events of September 1939, which forced the government of the Republic of Poland into exile. Then, in February 1945, after the Yalta conference, it became clear that the Allies intended to cease to recognize the Polish Government-in-Exile and its armed forces. It seemed obvious that many Poles would want to remain in the West with their families. It was thus important to secure the documents generated by that government and the armed forces. On the initiative of Col. Zygmunt Borkowski, the director of the Archive and Museum Services, a plan was established to appoint an institution modelled on the Polish Library in Paris and the Museum in Rapperswil. This plan was accepted by President Władysław Raczkiewicz and Prime Minister Tomasz Arciszewski, and in this way, in 1945, the Gen. Sikorski Historical Institute was founded, with, at its core, Department “S”  under director Dr Edmund Oppman and his wife Regina. The Institute issued an appeal to civilians, military personnel and organizations for donations of documents for its collections. Some people made bequests ensuring that their valuable collections would later pass to the Institute’s archive. This archive is now generally regarded as holding the most important Polish émigré collections in the world. Together with the museum and the two libraries it is an integral part of the Institute. "

                        "name": "World Jewish Relief",
                        "history": "World Jewish Relief was originally called the Central British Fund for German Jewry (CBF) and was founded in 1933. CBF was founded following a meeting of UK Jewish community leaders with Members of Parliament. Founding members included Simon Marks, chairman and managing director of Marks & Spencer, Sir Robert Waley Cohen, managing director of Shell Oil, Lionel and Anthony de Rothschild, managing partners of N M Rothschild & Sons, and Dr Chaim Weizmann, who would later become the first President of Israel. Originally intended to provide support for German Jews who were immigrating to the British Mandate of Palestine, CBF originally funded projects such at Hebrew University, the Technion, and the Maccabi World Union so that these organisations could provide immigrants with the skills and experience needed to become functional members of society in Palestine.\r\n\r\nDue to funding problems, CBF increasingly turned its efforts away from Palestine and towards Britain. By 1935, CBF and the Jewish Refugees Committee (JRC) were funding a programme that placed Jewish scholars in British universities willing to take on faculty members and graduate students. The two programmes placed more than 200 refugees at universities, including Ernst Chain, whose subsequent work on penicillin earned him a Nobel Prize.\r\n\r\nCBF coordinated with the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) in 1936 to create the Council for German Jewry, which carried out much of the pre-war operations to emigrate German Jews. Resulting from the German-Austrian Anschluss in 1938, thousands of new refugees in Austria looked to emigrate. Due to the volume of need for refugees, the Council for German Jewry attended the Évian Conference in France to push world leaders for less restrictive immigration policies, but they were largely ignored The advent of Kristallnacht later in that year exacerbated the refugee crisis, leaving the JDC overwhelmed in both financial and human resource capacity. The Council for German Jewry was eventually able to persuade the UK Home Office to admit Jews regardless of financial backing, and consequently 68,000 Jews registered before the start of war. For its part, CBF worked with the NGO Save the Children to establish the Inter-Aid Committee, which helped 471 Jewish and Christian children go to boarding schools in Britain.\r\n\r\nWorks:\r\n\r\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 prompted CBF to shift the focus of its aid efforts to support the two million Jews living there. CBF changed its name to World Jewish Relief in 1994 and has since the early 1990s focused on addressing the causes of poverty in the communities in which it works, in addition to meeting immediate needs. World Jewish Relief integrated with World Jewish Aid in 2007. World Jewish Relief currently funds three main types of projects: meeting immediate needs of vulnerable communities, securing sustainable livelihoods for those in poverty, and responding to international disasters.\r\n\r\n-Meeting Immediate Needs: World Jewish Relief works with vulnerable communities in the Former Soviet Union (FSU), primarily in Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, and Georgia, who often depend on meagre state pensions or welfare entitlements. In those areas, the charity funds homecare, medical expenses and food for clients, and supplements this programme through a Gifts in Kind programme that delivers donated materials directly to the communities in which it works. World Jewish Relief also works in communities to repair and renovate cold and insecure homes, offering their residents relief from the harsh winter weather conditions. The charity also works with partners in Ukraine to provide support for socially isolated communities, and it works with partners in Ukraine, Moldova and India to empower people living with disabilities there, with services including job training, specialist therapy, and wheelchair accessibility improvements.\r\n-Sustainable Livelihoods: World Jewish Relief launched its Livelihood Development Programme (LDP) in 2009, which currently operates in Moldova and Ukraine. The Moldova LDP works with women from vulnerable communities to provide job training, as well as Romanian language instruction, with the goal of program graduates finding employment and increased income. The Ukraine LDP works with men and women to provide job trainings and establish job centres in local Jewish Community Centres. World Jewish Relief also works with partners in Rwanda to provide educational and vocational training to orphaned and street children.\r\n-Disaster Response: World Jewish Relief leads the British Jewish community's response to international disasters, recently working in Japan, Pakistan, Haiti, and countries in East Africa. In Japan, World Jewish Relief worked with Save the Children to establish spaces for displaced children following the 2011 tsunami there. After the 2010 floods in Pakistan, World Jewish Relief worked with partners to provide immediate needs to displaced communities in Bagh District and restore homes that had been damaged or destroyed. WJR still works with partners there to train women affected by the flood in embroidery techniques. World Jewish Relief worked with Merlin following the 2010 Haiti earthquake to provide medical services for those in need, and it worked primarily in Kenya with partners to provide food services for those suffering from the East Africa food crisis.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.worldjewishrelief.org/about-us/history"

                        "name": "British Pathé News",
                        "history": "Its roots lie in 1896 Paris, France, when Société Pathé Frères was founded by Charles Pathé and his brothers, who pioneered the development of the moving image. Charles Pathé adopted the national emblem of France, the cockerel, as the trademark for his company. After the company, now called Compagnie Générale des Éstablissements Pathé Frère Phonographes & Cinématographes, invented the cinema newsreel with Pathé-Journal. French Pathé began its newsreel in 1908 and opened a newsreel office in Wardour Street, London in 1910.\r\n\r\nThe newsreels were shown in the cinema and were silent until 1928. At first, they ran for about four minutes and were issued fortnightly. During the early days, the camera shots were taken from a stationary position but the Pathé newsreels captured events such as Franz Reichelt's fatal parachute jump from the Eiffel Tower and suffragette Emily Davison's fatal injury by a racehorse at the 1913 Epsom Derby.\r\n\r\nDuring the First World War, the cinema newsreels were called the Pathé Animated Gazettes, and for the first time this provided newspapers with competition. After 1918, British Pathé started producing a series of cinemazines, in which the newsreels were much longer and more comprehensive. By 1930, British Pathé was covering news, entertainment, sport, culture, and women's issues through programmes including the Pathétone Weekly, the Pathé Pictorial, the Gazette and Eve’s Film Review.\r\n\r\nIn 1927, the company sold British Pathé (both the feature film and the newsreel divisions) to First National. (French Pathé News continued until 1980, and the library is now part of the Gaumont-Pathé collection.) Pathé changed hands again in 1933, when it was acquired by British International Pictures, which was later known as Associated British Picture Corporation. In 1958, it was sold again to Warner Bros. and became Warner-Pathé. Pathé eventually stopped producing the cinema newsreel in February 1970 as it could no longer compete with television. During the newsreels' run, the narrators included Bob Danvers-Walker, Dwight Weist, Dan Donaldson, André Baruch and Clem McCarthy among others."

                        "history": "IWM was founded on 5 March 1917 when the War Cabinet approved a proposal by Sir Alfred Mond MP for the creation of a national war museum to record the events still taking place during the Great War. The intention was to collect and display material as a record of everyone’s experiences during that war - civilian and military - and to commemorate the sacrifices of all sections of society.\r\n\r\nThe interest taken by the Dominion governments led to the renaming of the National War Museum to Imperial War Museum later in 1917. It was formally established by Act of Parliament in 1920 and a governing Board of Trustees appointed.\r\n\r\nThe museum was opened in the Crystal Palace by King George V on 9 June 1920. From 1924 to 1935 it was housed in two galleries adjoining the former Imperial Institute, South Kensington. On 7 July 1936, the Duke of York, shortly to become King George VI, reopened the museum in its present home on Lambeth Road, South London, formerly the central portion of Bethlem Royal Hospital, or ‘Bedlam’.\r\n\r\nWith the onset of war in 1939 IWM’s remit was extended to include the Second World War. While a programme of collecting got underway, vulnerable collections were evacuated to stores outside London, and the museum was closed to the public from September 1940 to November 1946. Most of the exhibits survived the war, but a Short Seaplane which had flown at the Battle of Jutland was shattered when a German bomb fell on the Naval Gallery on 31 January 1941. This was just one of more than 40 incendiary hits on the building throughout the war.\r\n\r\nThe Korean War led to a further redefinition of the IWM’s terms of reference to include all conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces had been involved since 1914. IWM has therefore continued to collect every type of evidence documenting its very broad remit. Its collections are vast and rich, and in addition to its role as a museum, IWM is also a major national art gallery, a national archive of written and audio-visual recourse, and a centre for research.\r\n\r\nThe distinct Department of Documents was created in the early 1970s with the purpose of acquiring and preserving an extensive collection of British and Commonwealth private papers. The Department also acts as an official place of deposit for large holdings of foreign documents of mainly German origin. This archival material is available for study by members of the public, and is regularly used in books, newspaper articles and television and radio broadcasts concerning the personal experience of warfare since 1914."

A major role was played by Halina Czarnocka, who for 37 years, until 1988, was the director of the SPP archive. In that year, financial difficulties forced the merger of the SPP with the Gen. Sikorski Polish Institute.

                        "name": "British Library",
                        "history": "The British Library came into existence in 1973 as a result of the British Library Act. Parliament’s vision was for a single institution at the heart of the UK’s information network, which would aid scientific and technological research, business, the arts and humanities.\r\n\r\nTo make this happen, several organisations were brought together to create a national library.\r\n\r\nThe British Museum Library, founded in 1753, contained one of the world’s largest collections of books, manuscripts and periodicals, both contemporary and antique, British and foreign.\r\n\r\nIt was created as ‘one general repository’ to hold the collections of Sir Hans Sloane, Sir Robert Cotton and Robert and Edward Harley. When it inherited the library of George III in 1823, its printed books doubled in number, prompting a move to the site of the current British Museum.\r\n\r\nOpening in 1857, the Library’s Round Reading Room – with its magnificent domed roof – became an iconic destination in the literary landscape of London. George Gissing used it as the setting of his 1891 novel New Grub Street, describing it as ‘the valley of the shadow of books’, while lamenting the difficulties of obtaining a Reader ticket. Its roof was also used in the climax of Alfred Hitchcock’s film Blackmail (1929).\r\n\r\nThe room welcomed many famous visitors including Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Karl Marx, George Bernard Shaw and Virginia Woolf. Lenin too applied for a Reader ticket, adopting the pseudonym Jacob Richter to cover his tracks from the Russian authorities.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, some of our most precious treasures were moved to a secure cave in Aberystwyth, with round the clock guards. Meanwhile, the Newspaper Library in Colindale, north London, suffered substantial damage from bombing and some of the collection had to be transferred to quarries in Wiltshire while repairs were made.\r\n\r\nOne of the first challenges for the new British Library in 1973 was to find a premises to bring together these disparate collections and institutions.\r\n\r\nAn old rail goods yard in St Pancras would become our home. Opening its doors to the public in November 1997 and receiving an official inauguration by HM Queen Elizabeth II the following June, the Library became the largest public building constructed in Britain in the last 100 years.\r\n\r\nAlthough its modernist design by architect Sir Colin St. John Wilson originally divided critics, the building achieved Grade 1 listed status in 2015. Today it lies at the centre of an area of huge regeneration, home to the Knowledge Quarter and Google."

                        "history": "The Jewish Museum was founded in 1932 by Professor Cecil Roth, Alfred Rubens and Wilfred Samuel. Originally located in Woburn House in Bloomsbury, it moved to an elegant early Victorian listed building in Camden Town in 1994.\r\nThe London Museum of Jewish Life was founded in 1983 as the Museum of the Jewish East End with the aim of rescuing and preserving the disappearing heritage of London’s East End – the heartland of Jewish settlement in Britain. While the East End has remained an important focus, the museum expanded to reflect the diverse roots and social history of Jewish people across London, including the experiences of refugees from Nazism. It also developed an acclaimed programme of Holocaust and anti-racist education.\r\n\r\nIn 1995 the two museums were amalgamated. Between 1995 and 2007 the combined Jewish Museum ran on two sites, but with a long term aim to find the means to combine the two collections, activities and displays within a single site.\r\n\r\nFollowing years of planning and fundraising the museum bought a former piano factory behind the Camden Town site and raised the required funds to combine and remodel the buildings. The new Museum opened to the public on 17 March 2010.\r\n\r\nIn 2015 the Jewish Museum London partnered with the Jewish Military Museum. The partnership has seen the Jewish Museum London assume care and responsibility for the Jewish Military Museum’s entire collection, research archive and its learning programme. Key objects from the Jewish Military Museum are now on display and integrated into the existing permanent galleries."

While strongly welcoming David’s initiative, the University of Oxford emphasised that the Centre must be financially self-supporting as there was no scope for allocating funds to it from the University’s central budget. This position has remained to the present day.\r\n \r\nThe Centre was originally based at the Oriental Institute in Pusey Lane, Oxford, and later moved to rented premises at 45 St Giles’ (a building owned by St John’s College) in order to accommodate the increase in staff numbers and to provide more teaching rooms. At the same time, the Centre acquired the use of Yarnton Manor, an early seventeenth-century house and rural estate just outside Oxford, in 1973 through the generous action of the Charles Wolfson Charitable Trust.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, in the autumn of 2000, the Centre’s physical integration with the University was advanced through the formation of the Oxford University Teaching and Research Unit in Hebrew and Jewish Studies, later known as the Hebrew and Jewish Studies Unit of the University of Oxford. It was housed on the Oriental Institute’s third floor, the construction of which was funded by the Centre’s supporters.\r\n \r\nIn September 2014, the activities of the Unit were brought together with the research activities which had been housed in Yarnton and the combined operations of the Centre were relocated to the Clarendon Institute, a late-Victorian building in central Oxford owned by the University.\r\n \r\nSeveral years later, in September 2018, the research activities of the Centre were incorporated into a new Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies of the University of Oxford. This new academic Centre, which reports to the University through the Faculty of Oriental Studies, is fully funded by the charitable Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies and is directed by the Centre’s President.\r\n\r\nIn 2022, the OCHJS celebrated its 50th anniversary."

The legal framework for them was laid down in 1946/1991. As in most countries, there are laws on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal and sensitive data (1991, 1997), and records may be restricted for a period of 30 years. In addition to the state archives, there are also collections in private archives and museums.",

The Jewish Community of Thessaloniki (General Communal Archives) holds the declarations of finances and property completed by its members prior to their deportation to Auschwitz in 1943.

EHRI approach to Greece: Pre-existing research, third-party surveys, available archival guides, and expert support**\r\n\r\nWhen EHRI began its work, a number of studies on the Holocaust in Greece were available, such as Hagen Fleischer’s *Crown and Swastika: Greece during the Occupation and the Resistance, 1941-1944* (1995) and Steven Bowman’s *The Agony of Greek Jews* (2009). Other important works on the subject include a number of publications which are available only in Greek:\r\n\r\n- [2012] Varon-Vassard, Odette, *I Analysi Mias Dyskolis Mnimis.

This series is co-published by EHRI-partner Institute for Contemporary History Munich-Berlin [Institut für Zeitgeschichte München-Berlin, IfZ]. A translation of the series into English under the title *The Persecution and Murder of European Jews by Nazi Germany, 1933–1945* is under preparation with the cooperation of Yad Vashem.\r\n\r\nThe GSA has an online catalogue, Arxeiomnimon (2013): http://arxeiomnimon.gak.gr/. Containing some seven million pages of documents it allows navigation through parts of the archival collections originating from 37 GSA agencies (the central service and 36 branches). It should be noted that while the metadata fields are provided in English, the actual descriptions are in Greek. Furthermore, those agencies and materials not included in Arxeiomnimon as of yet are either uncatalogued, or published in Greek-language finding aids or index cards stored in the reading rooms of the respective branches. These published finding aids and index cards, however, are less standardized than the online database.\r\n\r\nThe Hellenic Literary and Historical Archive, better known as E.L.I.A. (part of the National Bank of Greece Cultural Foundation, M.I.E.T.) also has an extensive online Greek language catalogue which meets international metadata standards: http://www.elia.org.gr/ \r\n\r\nAnother useful online resource is the [Database of Greek-Jewish Holocaust Survivors’ Testimonies](http://gjst.ha.uth.gr/en/theproject.php), which has built up a vast collection of audio and visual testimonies from Greek Jews who survived the Holocaust. The database is a virtual archive that systematically brings together testimonies from repositories in Greece and abroad, public and private collections, collected in different languages and places, at different times. \r\nEHRI started its identification and investigation work for data integration on Greece from researcher interviews carried out by the “user requirements” for the project. By linking data integration and user requirements, EHRI aims to ensure that the EHRI Portal will attract historians, archivists, and the general public, and that it identifies the data that researchers hope to find on the EHRI Portal, in order to generate more interest and offer more meaningful content and format. Researchers of the Holocaust in Greece interviewed by EHRI were asked to suggest further researchers specialized in Holocaust history in Greece to participate in an EHRI workshop on data integration and Holocaust research in Greece, which took place in December 2012. Four representatives of archival institutions in Greece, three graduate students, two junior and two senior researchers participated in the workshop.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the workshop was to receive expert feedback on this list and further complete EHRI’s overview of the archival institutions and identify Holocaust-related collections within the institutions. EHRI also needed to better understand the format of the metadata and detect where further surveying was necessary. The overall goal was to create a state-of-the-art report of identified Holocaust-related sources in Greece and to add this information to the EHRI portal, as much as possible via the technical Work Packages (as opposed to manually entering the information into the portal).\r\n\r\nThe Greek workshop has had multiple benefits for EHRI as it has helped ensure that the content fits the user. It was a time-efficient identification method which avoided duplication of work. At the same time, it was an investment in smooth communication with future Portal users. We found that the EHRI Portal can support Holocaust-research in Greece by improving access to information about the materials, be it awareness about and location of repositories or identifying relevant collections within repositories. Engaging with the research community can help EHRI further enrich the data by annotating and adding it to the portal. A second important role for EHRI can be to reach out to the institutions and offer them tools and a platform to share the information about their holdings to the research community.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Greek archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nA major challenge in Greece is that there are an unknown number of materials which remain largely invisible. As a consequence, there is no indication about their existence online and there is a huge (digital) description backlog, which requires thorough identifying and inventorying. As a consequence, uncatalogued materials remain hidden.\r\n\r\nFinding aids are often only consultable at the repository itself. The limited amount of online information and locally available cataloguing systems make access to the physical materials time consuming, often costly, and inefficient (a research trip is hard to prepare).\r\n\r\nAnother challenge concerns receiving permission for consultation. Access to public archives in Greece often requires an application procedure before any access is granted. Two laws regulate the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal and sensitive archives (1991 and 1997). The time limit for keeping records restricted was reduced from fifty to thirty years (although there is room for flexibility in certain cases). In some cases it is not possible or there are limits to taking photographs as well as making scans or photocopies. Sometimes, a reading room’s lack of capacity can be an issue.\r\n\r\nAt the Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, not all archives can be made publicly accessible for reasons of national security, among others. Moreover, there has been at least one case where a collection of documents concerning the Holocaust was removed from the original collections and was put in one separate collection, leading to a loss of context.\r\n\r\nAnother issue pertains to the destruction of archives. The destruction of archives does not only apply to Holocaust archives, but has included sources Holocaust-related sources. For example, the archives of the Greek Agency for War Crimes, which was founded in the autumn of 1945, were totally destroyed in 1975. In some cases, materials have been scanned before destruction. The Jewish Community of Thessaloniki, which engages in such digitization projects, has preserved certain sources in this way. \r\n\r\nYet another challenge is that material is in the possession of private organisations which do not necessarily consider themselves archival institutions. These archives are hard to locate and often remain “hidden treasures”. Being able to share the knowledge on the mere existence of these hidden treasures by entering or annotating them to the EHRI portal could already be a major step forward for Greek Holocaust research, especially at the local level, in Jewish community archives.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Greece**\r\n\r\nIn Greece, EHRI identified 43 Holocaust-relevant repositories, and was able to present 96 archival descriptions by December 2018. While many archival institutions can be found, predictably, in the country’s capital, Athens, important collections are also held by regional branches of the General State Archives (GSA), especially in Greece’s northern regions, i.e. in Central Macedonia, as well as in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace.\r\n\r\nThe largest institution for EHRI’s purposes in Greece, the General State Archives (National Archives of Greece, GSA), are the national institution responsible for the preservation and promotion of the Greek archival materials. The institution was created in 1914 and its operation is organized by law. The Greek State Archives consist of a central service, 47 regional services and 16 local archives. Based on the location of the wartime Jewish communities in Greece – in at least 27 cities according to the Central Board of Jewish Communities of Greece (2009) – researchers will have to visit different GSA branches if they wish to consult archives relating to particular communities. It is also important to keep in mind that a large amount of the material in the GSA remains non-digital and not all the digitized materials have been included in Arxeiomnimon yet.\r\n\r\nIn March 2008, all branches of the GSA were asked to provide an overview of collections and documents related to the history of the Jews in Greece and the Holocaust in order to prepare the survey work of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM). The responses were rather limited: fifteen to twenty local offices submitted such a report, which varied from a short note confirming there is such material available to an overview of records. These overviews have served as orientation tools for EHRI’s work in Greece. \r\n\r\nBeyond the GSA’s collections, the Jewish Museum of Greece (JMG) conserves more than 2,000 artefacts, including books and pamphlets, periodicals, maps, documents, manuscripts (personal notes, correspondence, memoires, diaries, etc.), false IDs, personal objects, ritual objects, jewellery, textiles and costumes, clothing, badges, armbands, numismatics (coins, banknotes, stock certificates) and an art collection. The JMG’s Holocaust archive includes records of the Central Agency for the Custody of Jewish Property (the Ypiresias Diacheirisis Israilitikon Periousion, Y.D.I.P. archive), the Ο.Π.Α.Ι.Ε archive (O.P.A.I.E., the Heirless Property and Jewish Rehabilitation Fund), private and personal archives which include material pertinent to the Shoah, the JMG Archive of Oral Testimonies and a Photographic Archive. The JMG’s Holocaust Photographic Archive has a rich and expanding collection of photographic images spanning from the pre-war period to the early 1950s. The broad subject areas, each including several subcategories, capture Jewish life before, during and after the Second World War and the Holocaust. An extensive number of document scans and photographs of the museum’s collection have been uploaded in Judaica Europeana.\r\n\r\nWhile EHRI has identified a considerable number of archives and institutions with Holocaust-relevant collections, many others are yet to be located. For example, the location of the Police and Army Archives remains unknown. The same goes for sources relating to two concentration camps in Greece where Jews were imprisoned. Archival documentation on their presence is missing. In other cases, EHRI is aware of the existence of archives that are likely to hold Holocaust-related materials, but is yet to ascertain the significance of their collections. Archives and institutions that fall under this category include: the Chamber of Commerce, the Court House and other juridical archives; municipal archives; church archives (for example: the archives of the Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church); Communist Party Archives; Red Cross Archives; public and private company archives (electricity, water, port companies); and private collections kept in museums, at home, or in private institutions. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the identification of the relevant repositories, EHRI has also found that certain archives, which were originally thought to hold Holocaust-related materials, do not in fact have such material. For example, it was found that not all municipal archives of cities with a Jewish community during the Second World War, had kept their collections, but had transferred them to local GSA branches.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Greece, archives and collections relevant to the period of the Holocaust in Greece can be found in a number of countries, some of which are partially covered by Holocaust-relevant archival guides. For Germany, for instance, there is Irith Dublon-Knebel’s overview *German Foreign Office Documents on the Holocaust in Greece* (2007), while for Italy, there are collections of documents edited by Daniel Carpi, *Italian Diplomatic Documents on the History of the Holocaust in Greece* (1941-1943), Tel Aviv, Diaspora Research Center-Tel Aviv University, 1999.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, relevant archival holdings are located at the Political Archive of the German Foreign Office in Berlin, the Federal Archives-Department Military Archives in Freiburg, the Federal Archives-The Central Office for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes in Lundwigsburg, and the Arolsen Archives.

A special note needs to be made about copies of the archives of the following Greek Jewish communities which were copied and made available for research at USHMM, but remain largely inaccessible for research in Greece itself for various reasons (including lack of resources).

Karamanlis’ Foundation, established in 1983, an important centre for the preservation of historical memory and facilitation of scientific research, is the outcome of private initiative. Three eminent personalities of the world of letters, well aware of the conjunction of circumstances, Konstantinos Tsatsos, Κonstantinos Τrypanis and Konstantinos Svolopoulos, incited by the establishment of such foundations in the broader international sphere, addressed a letter to Konstantinos Karamanlis on 14 May 1983, in which among other issues the following was stressed: “every citizen, and the prominent especially, have the duty to care for preserving in the memory of those to come after them, the political events constituting the history of their era… Motivated by the above sentiments, we have decided on an initiative with the objective of conservation of written texts and oral testimonies of the historical period of our lifetime, which coincides with the period during which you yourself played a leading role in Greece’s political life…”\r\n \r\nKonstantinos Karamanlis responded positively to the proposal and proceeded to the establishment of the Foundation, in the conviction that “History must not be forgotten” and that “the teachings of history are always opportune”.\r\nHis decision to entrust his political archive to a non-profit Foundation to bear his name, was a pioneering act and contributed decisively to a scholarly approach of essence toward the problems of contemporary Greek history. His example was subsequently followed by other Greek politicians, and the foundations established with similar characteristics are evidence of Karamanlis’ timely response to the general spirit reigning at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Foundation’s primary goal is as comprehensively as possible to cast light on the historical events of the period after World War II, in conjunction with systematic study and research of what was accomplished by Konstantinos Karamanlis, and the promotion of the idea of a unified Europe. A fundamental prerequisite for attaining this goal was the collection, conservation and valorization of his personal archive, aspiring to the promotion of scientific research unconnected to any political or other expediency.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is a legal entity under private law subject to the legislation regarding non-profitable foundations. Its establishment and operation is exclusively dependent on the financial support of private individuals, Karamanlis’ close relatives and friends. \r\n"

                        "history": "Prime Minister Alexandros Papanastassiou decided to found a university in Thessaloniki in 1924. The University of Thessaloniki started operating in 1925 and the University Library was founded in 1927. All schools of the University including the Library were located in a building right next to the Jewish cemetery. The mansion on the Ethnikis Amynis St served as the 2nd Military Hospital of the city during the WWI and hosted the university administration and the library till the 1970s.\r\n\r\nThe AUTh Library started operating in 1927 with an almost zero budget. The need for scholar information motivated professors and Greek scholars from diaspora to actively engage in enriching the library’s collections. The initial core of the Library collection was the donation of G. Konstantinidis, books from school libraries, namely Gymnasium of Thessaloniki, the All-Male Teacher Training School and the Education Academy of Thessaloniki. To this initial core more books from school collections were added; books that were initially collected for the \"Frontistirion\" of Trebizond (K. Konstantinidis’ donation) but never reached Asia Minor due to the destruction of 1922 and books from other Asia Minor schools saved from destruction and transferred in Thessaloniki by the “Fund for Exchangeable Property”. Georgios Konstantinidis was a former National Library of Greece Director (1890-91, 1895) and donated his library of 8.000 books to the Aristotle University. Gymnasium of Thessaloniki was a Hellenic school operating during the Ottoman occupation in Thessaloniki and its books were mostly Ancient Greek literature classics. All-Male Teacher Training School was a 3-year school operating during 1914-1929. Its books were mostly historic and travel books. K. Konstantinidis was a rich trader from Trebizond (1856 - 1930) that worked hard for the creation of an independent Democracy of Pontos. Library's collection further developed through printed journals subscriptions and important private collections either donated or purchased, such as N. Politis, A. Svolos, A. Delmouzos, A. Papanastassiou, M. Triantafyllidis, A. Pallis, I. Trikoglou collections.\r\n\r\nThanks to all these efforts, the AUTh Library collections go back in time presenting diversity in terms of language, place, genre, and format. Some collection highlights include 113 manuscripts dating from the 10th century, rare books dating from 1495, and maps from the 16th century. Nowadays, the library’s collection includes more than 1.302.000 printed and electronic books, access to 16.000 electronic journals and 64 bibliographic databases (AUTh Library and HEAL-Link consortium subscriptions). The AUTh Library actively supports the Open Access Movement since 2003. Hence, digitization and open access to theses and dissertations awarded from AUTh are two ongoing services reaching in total more than 4.000.000 million pages (archival collections, books, articles, newspapers, doctoral & postgraduate dissertations, research papers published by AUTh Faculty, etc.).\r\nCommunities and important Greek scholars continue to enrich the collections. Professors leaving on pension often donate their collections and papers to the Library. In 2014, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki was offered access to the Visual History Archive (USC Shoah Foundation, c2019), a collection of interviews of Holocaust and other genocides’ survivors. In 2018, the Visual History Archive became a Proquest company product. The perpetual access to the archive was donated to Aristotle University of Thessaloniki by the German Consulate in Thessaloniki as a tribute to the 60.000 Jews from Thessaloniki that were deported to Nazi concentration camps. In 2016, professor I. Megas and poet N. Christianopoulos donated their collections to Aristotle University containing thousands of postcards, art items, books, manuscripts, correspondence, interviews, journals, etc. In 2019, the Central Macedonia Regional Unit and its Cultural Centre have donated the “Centre for the Study and Development of Hellenic Culture of the Black Sea” archives and the library. The Black Sea Centre was founded in 1996 and operated until 2011. During its operations, the Black Sea Centre developed a series of cultural activities, it actively recorded the presence of Greeks in the area in terms of monitoring the numbers of Greek education schools and teachers, and clubs. Moreover, it gained copies from former USSR archives or State Archives from Black Sea countries that involved the Greek presence in the area. The Endowed Chair of Pontic Studies took the initiative for this donation and the transfer costs were covered by the Charitable Foundation of Ivan Savvidi.\r\n\r\nExcerpt from the following article: Koseoglou, E., & Zapounidou, S.

In April 1833, King Otto issued a royal decree aimed at the reconstruction of the state, making radical changes in almost all the basic institutions. This decree provided, amongst other things, for the foundation of an Archives Section as part of the newly constituted 'Secretariat of Foreign Affairs'. It was not until 1910, however, that an Archive Service with specific responsibilities and tasks was founded within the M.F.A. under the jurisdiction of the General Director of Political Affairs. \r\nDuring the German Occupation (1941-1944) the operation of the Foreign Ministry, and by extension of all its Services, was suspended, and access to the archives was strictly forbidden. After the liberation of Greece the record groups were in complete disarray: it became clear that the collection had been partly ransacked and selectively destroyed. Some of the files had been carried off when the Occupation forces departed for Germany, while a number of documents had been removed and destroyed, as was evident from the gaps found in the chronological sequence of the record groups when they were returned in sacks by the American army. The task of reclassifying the archives began in 1945 and was completed five years later. Although the Foreign Ministry files became available to scholars in 1959, research continued to be at a rudimentary level in terms of means and organisation of material, and also of the number of researchers who showed interest in the respective files. It was only after 1994 that significant progress in the reorganisation and modernisation of the Directorate of Archives in all respects has been achieved. This significant progress, can, to a large extent, be attributed to the re-establishment and upgrading of the Directorate of Archives, which, according to the New Regulation of the Hellenic Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1998), was renamed as the Service of Historical Archives.

The network of public archives consists of the Croatian State Archive [Hrvatski državni arhiv, HDA] in Zagreb as the central archival institution, and 17 regional archives, as well as two branches and eight archive collection centres (http://www.arhiv.hr/Arhivska-služba/Arhivi-u-Hrvatskoj) . The Croatian State Archive is responsible for documents of central administration bodies and other records significant for the Republic of Croatia. The regional state archives are responsible for the records of local and regional authorities within their purview, which can include private organisations and institutions, business entities, and distinguished families and individuals.

Next, EHRI identified the collections via a top-down approach starting with the institutions with the largest number of relevant collections (Croatian State Archive, The State Archive of the City of Zagreb; as well as those of cities like Slavonski Brod, Osijek, etc.).

EHRI approach to Croatia: Pre-existing research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nIn order to investigate and identify Holocaust-related sources in Croatian archives, EHRI enlisted a local expert and reviewed the pertinent research. EHRI was able to draw on pre-existing research, such as: Narcisa Lengel Krizman ed. *Zna li se: Antisemitizam – Holokaust – Antifašizam* (1996) also in English as *Anti-semitism, Holocaust, Anti-Fascism* (1997); Ivo and Slavko Goldstein’s *Holokaust u Zagrebu* (2001); Zlata Živaković-Kerže, *Stradanja i pamćenja: Holokaust u Osijeku i život koji se nastavlja* (2006); Đuro Zatezalo, Jadovno. Kompleks ustaških logora 1941, I–II (2007); Vladimir Geiger / Martina Grahek Ravančić / Marica Karakaš Obradov (eds.) *Logori, zatvori i prisilni rad u Hrvatskoj/Jugoslaviji 1941–1945, 1945–1951* (2010); Alexander Korb’s *Im Schatten des Weltkriegs: Massengewalt der Ustasa gegen Serben, Juden und Roma in Kroatien 1941–1945* (2013); Marica Karakaš Obradov, “Prisilne migracije židovskog stanovništva na području Nezavisne Države Hrvatske”, *Croatica Christiana periodica* 37:72 (2013); Marica Karakaš Obradov, “Iseljavanje Židova iz Hrvatske nakon Drugoga svjetskog rata”, Historijski zbornik 66:2 (2013); Ivo Goldstein, Jasenovac (2018); Zdravko Dizdar, *Logor Danica u Koprivnici* 1941–1942, 1–3, (2017 – 2020); Naida-Michal Brandl, *Židovi u hrvatskoj nakon Holokausta* (2023). \r\n\r\nAs a result, a number of useful finding aids were identified. Online search tools are provided by both the Croatian State Archives and the National and University Library:\r\n- Hrvatski arhivski informacijski sustav / Croatian archival information system (https://hais.arhiv.hr/HDA/) \r\n- Biblionet (http://biblionet.arhiv.hr/)\r\n- The National and University Library (https://www.nsk.hr)\r\n\r\nA more traditional guide with general information about archives in Croatia is Igor Karaman’s *Studije i prilozi iz arhivistike* (Zagreb: Arhiv Hrvatske, 1993).\r\n\r\nFor a general guide on archival holdings in the Republic of Croatia see Vida Pavliček, “Pregled arhivskih fondova i zbirki Republike Hrvatske. Rad na prikupljanju i obradi podataka”, Arhivski vjesnik 50:1 (2007): 9–32. Regarding the archival material on the Holocaust, Josip Kolanović published a paper “Holocaust in Croatia – Documentation and research perspectives” Arhivski vjesnik 39 (1996): 157–174 and in 2013, the Croatian State Archives published an online paper presenting Holocaust-relevant collections (http://zagreb.arhiv.hr/hr/teme/holokaust.htm). It should also be noted that most collections in the Croatian State Archive and other state archives throughout the country have their own finding aids with descriptions of what can be found in which box of an entire collection. Some collections are better explored than others, often depending on the interests of archivists who use the collections for PhD theses or other post-doc works. However, they are available only in the archives themselves, and not online. General Guide for Archival Holdings in Republic of Croatia (Pregled arhivskih fondova i zbirki Republike Hrvatske, Zagreb: Hrvatski državni arhiv, 2006–2007) is contemporary Croatian archives service obligatory finding aid, which provides basic data on archival holdings in Republic of Croatia in custody of archival, but also of non-archival institutions. It does not, however, single out “Holocaust” as a keyword. Its latest edition (2006) is not available in pdf.\r\n\r\nAs for surveys by third parties the USHMM has been intermittently active in Croatia since the late 1990s (Sporazum o suradnji između “United States Holocaust Memorial Museum-a” i Hrvatskog državnog arhiva. Bulletin. Hrvatski državni arhiv (Zagreb). 6:1–2 (1995): 17–18). During the 1990s, local experts surveyed and copied war-time material at the Zagreb State Archives. It leads an endeavor to digitalise material from other state archives in the country and pre-war records from Zagreb. The USHMM is also helping the Jewish Community in Zagreb archive to sort its material, which will later be digitalised. The microfilmed collections from the Second World War (surveyed in the 1990s), plus scanned material from the interwar period and the Second World War (ongoing survey) from different repositories around the country is gradually being put online. The work on the identification of the post-war material is in progress.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Croatian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAll collections are usually accessible to the public, but if a file refers to a person who was born less than 100 years ago, it will not be possible to copy that file. Each archival director is responsible for the approval of requests to scan or copy specific material submitted by individual research projects rather than through a more global agreement between institutions.\r\n\r\nAlthough important online search tools are available, they are of limited use for Holocaust scholars. Furthermore, keywords such as “Jewish” or “Holocaust” will not produce many results in these online search databases. Some collection descriptions on HAIS mention that “part of the material was copied for the needs of USHMM” (but typing “USHMM” into the search box will not lead one to collections copied for the USHMM).\r\n\r\nKnowledge of regional history, on how institutions were organized, and of who (or which political body) was in charge at given dates in time is essential to find relevant information within the body of archival material. In some cases, there is a high probability of identifying Holocaust-relevant files, but often it is more like “finding a needle in a haystack”. Researchers need to rely on assistance from local archivists to identify or at least narrow down the search for relevant information to a number of collections. However, this can still leave one with hundreds of boxes to consult without any firm indication of what they may contain.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Croatia**\r\n\r\n**C. I. In Croatia**\r\n\r\nEHRI identified and investigated Holocaust-relevant archival institutions and collections in Croatia in close cooperation with USHMM and Yad Vashem. The Croatian State Archive in Zagreb and the State Archive of the City of Zagreb are of particular importance. Two other state archives, in Osijek (a city with the second largest Jewish community in Croatia) and Rijeka (Fiume in Italian), a city in the northern Adriatic are equally important. These two archives are regional centres; Osijek has a rich Jewish history and was home to the second largest Jewish community in Croatia and during the Second World War the border town of Rijeka received thousands of Jewish refugees who had escaped To Italian held areas in NDH, or to the Italian territory. Three other cities with state archives and a relatively rich Jewish history are Varaždin, in the north, Slavonski Brod, which also has a relatively strong and as yet under-researched Jewish heritage, and Split, on the southern coast. Until the 19th century, Split’s Jewish community mostly consisted of Sephardic Jews, but this community also had roots dating back to the Roman period.\r\n\r\nApart from the State Archives, other important collection-holding institutions are the National and University Library in Zagreb (which stores interwar Jewish periodicals, some of which were published until April/May 1941), and the library and archive of the Jewish community center in Zagreb. At the time of writing, the latter is not yet open to the public as it is awaiting archival renovation and the sorting of its archival material into collections. There are smaller Jewish community archives in other Croatian cities and towns, which do not function as public institutions. One needs to first contact somebody from the local Jewish community to find out where they are and if their holdings can be consulted. However, the majority of archival collections of different Jewish communities in Croatia are held in the Jewish Historical Museum in Belgrade, Serbia.\r\n\r\nOther relevant institutions for Holocaust research in Croatia include the Documentation Center for Holocaust Victims and Survivors (CENDO), the Jasenovac Memorial and the Croatian History Museum of Croatia in Zagreb. The latter reported that they have some possibly interesting material concerning Croatian Jewish families within the Documentation and Information Department, and in the Photography department. However, the museum is under-staffed, so the archives have not been completely sorted and are not recognized as “Holocaust material” even though many of the families whose lives are documented perished during the war. The museum would like to see these materials labelled as Holocaust-related in the future. A similar situation applies to the Brod Regional Museum [Muzej Brodskog Posavlja] in Slavonski Brod.\r\n\r\nThe Archdiocesan Archives are now a part of the Croatian State Archive system, but some collections are held in a separate location within the church. Therefore, it has been added as a separate institution.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the USHMM and Yad Vashem, EHRI has yet to determine which archival institutions and collections outside of Croatia are relevant to Holocaust research on Croatia. Due to the fact that the territory of the NDH incorporated territory of the Eastern Srijem that s today’s Serbia as well as the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, some archives and museums in NW Serbia as well as those in Bosnia and Herzegovina, for example Banja Luka, Tuzla, Sarajevo, etc. have some documents relevant to Croatia. The Military Archives in Belgrade probably has archival collections relevant to the Holocaust in Croatia due to the fact that it still holds archival collections of the NDH and the Archives of Yugoslavia in Belgrade, is likely to hold relevant collections.",

In the Memorial Site the original sites of buildings and execution sites within the camp itself are marked by earth mounds and hollows. The path to the Flower Memorial is paved with railway sleepers. They denote symbolically part of the preserved railway track used to transport prisoners to the camp. Along with the memorial area, Jasenovac Memorial Site is responsible for the original, preserved camp building known as The Tower, the Stara Gradiška Camp cemetery, the Roma cemetery in Uštica and the mass graves in Krapje, Mlaka and Jablanac. Jasenovac Memorial Site, with the Memorial Museum, was founded in 1968 at the suggestion of the Federation of War Veterans' Organisations (SUBNOR) of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, Jasenovac Memorial Site and the Memorial Museum were founded“in order to preserve in perpetuity the remembrance of the victims of the Fascist terror and the soldiers of the People’s War of Liberation who fell in the Second World War in Jasenovac and Stara Gradiška Camps, and in order to preserve the achievements of Anti-Fascism.”(Act on Amendments to the Act on Jasenovac Memorial Site, OG 21/01). Jasenovac Concentration Camp was a place of imprisonment, forced labor and executions, primarily for the Serb Orthodox population which was, with the goal of creating an ethnically clean territory, to be completely eradicated from the Independent State of Croatia, as well as for Jews and Roma, who were discriminated against by racial laws. A large number of Croats was killed in the camp as well–communists and Anti-Fascists, members of the People’s Liberation Army of Croatia, as well as members of their families and other opponents of the Ustasha regime. The activities of Jasenovac Memorial Site have developed in different directions and include compiling, researching, scientifically processing, preserving and exhibiting the museum buildings and documents on how the Jasenovac Ustasha camp system operated; an educational programme; organising exhibitions and publications; ongoing co-operation with surviving prisoners and organising commemorative events in honour of the Jasenovac victims.Besides the Memorial Museum, the Education Centre is also part of Jasenovac Memorial Site. After the chaos of the 1991-1995 war in Croatia/ former Yugoslavia/, restoration followed, and the new permanent exhibition in the Jasenovac Memorial Site Memorial Museum was formally opened on 27 November 2006.Since it was impossible to display all the museum and archive material in a space of only 350 m², it was decided to adopt a multimedia approach, i.e. to present the museum inventory using different media, including photographic prints and documents, glass cabinet displays, digital presentations on screens, audio-visual presentations of survivor witness statements, etc. This method of presentation enabled visitors to the Museum to gain access to more information and allowed considerable more museum items to be presented than would have been possible using traditional displays.With this aim in mind, a database was created in which 65 topics were chronologically and thematically compiled in detail. An integral part of the database and the new permanent exhibition of the Memorial Museum of Jasenovac Memorial Site is the List of Individual Victims of Jasenovac Concentration Camp."

The royal decree issued on the 6th of December 1928 attested the existence of the Archives in Rijeka, but only as a branch of the Royal State Archives in Trieste. That status and the same name (R. Archivio di Stato – Sezione di Fiume) remained until the end of Italian rule in Rijeka in 1945. In the Yugoslav State, Rijeka was united with the People’s Republic of Croatia, which ended the unnatural separation from her Croatian hinterland. From 1945 until 1947, the archives were run as an independent institution, as Državni Arhiv Rijeka. In February 1948, it became an integral part of the Zagreb State Archives under the name Ispostava Državnog Arhiva u Zagrebu. By the end of 1949, the archives reverted to their former name and status as an independent institution. In 1959, the name was changed to Historijski Arhiv Rijeka and it operated under that name until 1993, when the name changed once again into Povijesni Arhiv Rijeka. Absorbed into the independent Croatian State the Archives, it was been renamed in 1997 as Državni Arhiv u Rijeci, the name which is still in use today."

Its beginnings are symbolically linked to the year 1643 when, according to a decision made by the Croatian parliament, state treasurer Ivan Zakmardi de Diankovec ordered the establishment of a special Chest of Privileges of the Kingdom in which to store the state's charters, privileges and legal regulations. It subsequently became the national archive and has since expanded through the establishment of separate units that assume specific roles within the archival service. The CSA today operates the following departments: the Department for the Protection and Processing of Archival Records, the Department for Information and Communication, the IT Department, the Croatian Film Archives, the Central Laboratory for Conservation and Restoration, the Central Laboratory for Photography, the Department of Comprehensive and Financial Services and the Department of Archives of the Archdiocese of Zagreb."

                        "history": "Since its early days, Dubrovnik, a medieval city, a commune, and then a republic, paid great attention to the protection of valuable documents. Thanks to old Dubrovnik's respect for the written word, today the State Archive's repositories stretch back nearly a thousand years - to the beginning of the 11th century.\r\n\r\nAmong the most valuable of the archive's collections are those dating back to the time of the Dubrovnik Republic. The oldest original document kept in this collection dates from the year 1022. This is a papal bull of Pope Benedict VIII addressed to the then Archbishop of Dubrovnik, Vital. \r\n\r\nAs a community whose overall development was based not on war but rather on trade, Dubrovnik concluded several agreements on friendship and free trade with similar communes from the wider Adriatic cultural sphere in the 12th and 13th centuries. Along with these agreements, the archives preserve numerous charters of peace and trade with rulers and lords from the near and further Balkan hinterland, with whom Dubrovnik was often in conflict because of their threat to Dubrovnik’s small territory and free trade.\r\nThe growth in trade indirectly influenced the creation of the Dubrovnik archives. Notably, in 1278, the Dubrovnik authorities decided to establish a communal notary service in order to deal with the increasing number of commercial and other activities, which required written agreements. The Italian Tomasino de Saver was appointed as the first notary public was appointed. In their notary books, Tomasino and his successors diligently recorded trade and sales agreements, money lending certificates, marriage contracts, wills of Dubrovnik aristocrats and commoners; in short, everything that characterised daily life in the city. These notary books today allow us to look to trace and study the daily micro-life of Dubrovnik throughout the past centuries; to find out how certain jobs were performed; what was traded; who married whom; who was rich and who was poor; and much, much more. \r\n\r\nThe Statute of the City of Dubrovnik and the Customs statute from the late 13th century, various other legal books, and decisions of the Dubrovnik Council, which in continuity can be traced from 1301 until the French occupation and the fall of the Dubrovnik Republic in 1808, provide a wealth of data Dubrovnik's legal system and its relation to foreign rulers and states. In 1358, the supreme authority of Venice over Dubrovnik came to an end. From then until 1526, Dubrovnik recognised the Croatian-Hungarian king as its supreme sovereign, and over the following centuries it paid tribute to the mighty Ottoman sultans. Nevertheless, from the early 15th century, Dubrovnik can be rightfully called a republic – an independent, sovereign and internationally recognized state. Throughout the Mediterranean and Europe, the Dubrovnik Republic had consulates and other diplomatic missions in the courts of many foreign rulers for centuries. Numerous traces of contacts with these establishments – directions to deputies, letters to consuls, but also charters of various contemporary European and world statesmen, kings and emperors from Spain, the Vatican, Austria, Turkey, through to the rulers of Germany, France, England, all the way to Russia and the United States , are carefully stored in the Dubrovnik Archives. \r\n\r\nThe majority of the archived books and documents, especially those from the earlier period, were written in Latin , which was then the official diplomatic language, but there are numerous documents in Italian and Croatian, and Turkish (over 15,000 Turkish laws) and, to a lesser extent, Spanish, Arabic, Portuguese, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Russian and Armenian."

                        "history": "Archival sources predating the end of the 17th century are rare for the region of Slavonia, Baranja, and Srijem, as practically all archives in the region were destroyed, especially during the Ottoman wars. Systematic care of the records started in the period after the end of Ottoman rule of Slavonia. The city statute of Osijek from 1698 adopted a provision that \"the tax and administrative documents, cash and city seal must be kept in a safe place.\" When Osijek became a free royal city in 1809, it modelled its archives after other cities. Other government bodies, the nobility, and the Church had archives, some of which are preserved today. The archives in Osijek included what was known then as the \"larger district of Osijek\", i.e., the present counties of Osijek-Baranja, Vukovar-Srijem, and Virovitica. A new chapter in the perception of archives as cultural heritage occurred after 1945. In 1947, the Ministry of Education established the Osijek branch of the State Archives in Zagreb. In 1957 a special archival sub-branch was founded, which collected, processed, and published important materials about the labour movement (Partijski arhiv), the Communist Party, and the partisan struggle during the Second World War. The archive was severely damaged during the war in 1991/1992, but was gradually repaired and resumed regular work. Because of the overwhelming needs of storing material and the lack of space in the central archive in Osijek, new archival collection centres were founded in the town of Vinkovci (1989) and Virovitica (1999). As of May 2009, the territorial jurisdiction of the State Archives in Osijek only extends to the territory of Osijek-Baranja County, as the newly formed National Archives in Vukovar began operating in January 2009 for their county, as did the State Archives in Virovitica in the same year, covering Virovitica county (all these are in the Slavonia region of Croatia)."

The Public Records Act was modified by Act LXI of 2012, which fundamentally changed Hungary’s archival system. On 1 October 2012, the Hungarian National Archives [Magyar Országos Levéltár], the central repository holding collections transferred from national government bodies, as well as all county and most of the city archives were integrated into the newly established National Archives of Hungary [Magyar Nemzeti Levéltár], a centralized, state-controlled body. There are a few municipal archives, which have not been merged into these new central archives, including the Budapest Municipal Archives.

EHRI has identified a significant number of Holocaust-relevant repositories in Hungary, a full list of which can be found in the extensive report. ",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Hungary: Pre-existing research and third-party surveys**\r\n\r\nThe first large-scale survey of Holocaust-related archival records in Hungary was launched in the late 1950s and early 1960s and was conducted by Elek Karsai and his associates on behalf of the National Agency of Hungarian Israelites (MIOK). It resulted in the publication of a three volume series – Benoschofsky Ilona, Karsai Elek (eds.), *Vádirat a nácizmus ellen. Dokumentumok a magyarországi zsidóüldözés történetéhez* 3 vols., Budapest: Magyar Izraeliták Országos Képviselete, Kiadói félvászonkötésben 1958-1967 – and a broad selection of documents known as “Series I” were made available on 180 microfilms in the Hungarian National Archives, Yad Vashem and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. In 1994, a follow-up project was launched by Ágnes Ságvári, which resulted in the creation of minor collections of selected Holocaust records in all the municipal (county) archives in Hungary, as well as a series of source publications. In 1993, a research guide to archival materials relevant for Jewish studies in Hungary (including some Holocaust-related parts as well) was published: György Haraszti and Géza Komoróczy (eds), *Magyar zsidó levéltári repertórium* [*Hungarian Jewish Archival Guide*] Vols. 1-2. Budapest: MTA Judaisztikai Kutatócsoport, 1993. Due to the re-organisation of the material, merging archives, newly found or added records and several other reasons, the information provided by this guide has remained incomplete, requiring updates and corrections.\r\n\r\nThe finding aids and descriptions available at archives in Hungary tend to provide scholars specialised in Holocaust Studies with little specific information. With the sole exception of the Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives, none of the archives in Hungary provide visitors with detailed finding aids in English. Only some offer online collection descriptions, but in most cases only a general overview of the holdings is available online. However, many institutions have launched digitisation projects and there is an increasing number of online finding aids.\r\n\r\nThe research teams of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Yad Vashem Archives have conducted extensive research in the previous two decades in Hungary. They prepared detailed collection-level and file-level descriptions for institutions of particular importance to Holocaust research, including the Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives, the National Archives of Hungary, the Budapest Municipal Archives, the Historical Archives of the State Security and the Institute and Museum of Military History.\r\n\r\nThe most recent major comprehensive documentary account on the topic in English is *The Holocaust in Hungary. Evolution of a Genocide* by Zoltán Vági, László Csősz and Gábor Kádár (Washington, DC: AltaMira Press-USHMM, 2013). The volume offers a selection of archival material from various archives in Hungary and abroad. The most relevant archival sources, especially on the history of the ghettoisation and deportation in 1944 are summarised in the entries of Randolph L. Braham (ed.), *Geographical Encyclopedia of the Holocaust in Hungary* (Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern University Press, 2013). \r\n\r\nEHRI’s experts on Hungary have made good use of the online finding aids on the microfilmed Hungarian records available on the USHMM website as well as of the valuable survey material we have obtained from colleagues at the Yad Vashem Archives. In addition, they have consulted archivists of the key collection-holding institutes.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Hungarian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAccording to the Act on public records, public archives and the protection of private archival holdings (in short: Archives Act, Act LXVI of 1995), public archives in Hungary were divided into national (general) archives, specialised state archives, municipal (city and county) archives, archives of public foundations and other public bodies, as well as private archives open to the public. The Public Records Act was modified by Act LXI of 2012, which brought about fundamental changes in the archival system. The Hungarian National Archives [Magyar Országos Levéltár], the central repository holding collections transferred from national government bodies as well as all county and most of the city archives, were integrated on 1 October 2012 into the newly established National Archives of Hungary [Magyar Nemzeti Levéltár], a centralised, state-controlled body. A few municipal archives have not been merged into these new central archives, including the Budapest Municipal Archives. In addition, there are several specialised archives, some 20 church and 20 Jewish community archives as well as other collection-holding institutions, including about 25 museums, major Budapest libraries, and private collections that hold records relevant for Holocaust research.\r\n\r\nIn Hungary, any person may, upon preliminary application, be granted free access to archival records held in public archives. Access to public records preserved in the National Archives of Hungary and its branch institutions are regulated by the Archives Act and its modifications since then (Amendment CXL of 1997. Enacting Clauses 19 and 20/1198. MKM), the Data Protection Act (LXIII of 1992) and the Privacy Act (LXV of 1995). One of the most important regulations concerning personal data of an individual mentioned in the records is that these data must not be published sooner than 30 years following the death of the person concerned, or if the year of death is unknown, for 90 years following the birth of the person concerned, or if both dates are unknown, for 60 years following the date of issue of the archival material concerned. “Personal data” is defined as any data that can be related to a certain natural person (“person concerned”) and any conclusion that can be drawn from such data about the person concerned.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Hungary**\r\n\r\n**C. I. In Hungary**\r\n\r\nIn Hungary, EHRI has so far identified a significant number of archival institutions, which are relevant for Holocaust research. EHRI has carried out archival descriptions in several of them: the Budapest-based Hungarian National Archives, the Budapest Municipal Archives, the Historical Archives of the Hungarian State Security, the Military History Archives, the Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives; the Holocaust Memorial Center; and the Pest County Archives.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nArchival sources pertaining to the Holocaust in Hungary can be found in the archives of all seven neighbouring countries (Austria, Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia) as well as in other foreign countries, most importantly Germany, Israel and the United States. Key foreign archives holding material pertaining to the Holocaust in Hungary include the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Archives, the Yad Vashem Archives, the Bundesarchiv, and the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington DC. While most records are written in Hungarian, finding aids and working languages differ in all these places. This continues to pose a serious challenge to researchers. Consequently, the identification and investigation of these archival documents require extensive international cooperation.\r\n",

The staff of the Central Library submitted a set of proposals, which were discussed at a meeting of the University’s Council on 10th March 1971 and the decision to establish an archive was made. As certain conditions necessary to receive the status of a specialised archives had not yet been met, the Archives was established as a section of the Central Library in 1972 and the professional organisation of the accumulated material began. The publication of an inventory of the Archives’ records prior to 1960 completed the process in 1975. The further collection of historically important records was prevented by a lack of space at the time but this obstacle was eliminated in 1984 by the opening of the Archives’ new premises. This created the ideal conditions for the work of the Archives to progress (the collection and organisation of records as well as the research and data service). On 1st January 1993, the Archive was finally given “specialised archive” status. It also participated in the foundation of the Budapest-Gödöllő Archives’ Association the same year, acting as one of its founding members. (The Association changed its name to the Hungarian University and College Archives’ Association in 1996 and then to the Hungarian University Higher Education Archives Association in 2001.) Construction work commenced in 2012 to refurbish the new premises of the Archives in the central building of the University. The Archives’ new office, research room and storeroom were inaugurated in festive circumstances on 13th March 2013."

                        "history": "The National Archives was established on 1 June 1988 following the amalgamation of the State Paper Office (SPO) and the Public Record Office of Ireland (PROI).\r\n\r\nThe SPO was established in 1702 as a repository for records relating to the administrations of the various Lords Lieutenant (the English monarch’s representative in Ireland) who, until that date, had taken all of their records with them on leaving office. The SPO was situated in Dublin Castle until 1990.\r\n\r\nThe PROI was established under the Public Records (Ireland) Act, 1867 to acquire administrative, court and probate records over twenty years old. The PROI building in the Four Courts was seized during the Civil War. The repository building was destroyed by fire in June 1922, along with most of the records, some dating back to the 13th century.\r\n\r\nFollowing the establishment of the modern Irish state in 1922, the PROI and SPO continued to function until the enactment of the National Archives Act, 1986, which transferred their functions and holdings to the newly established National Archives. Under this legislation, records of Government Departments and their agencies are transferred to the National Archives when they are 30 years old.\r\n\r\nIn 1989, the Government assigned premises at Bishop Street in Dublin to the National Archives. The premises of the former SPO in the Record Tower at Dublin Castle was vacated in August 1991 and the headquarters of the National Archives moved from the Four Courts to Bishop Street in September 1992."

                "situation": "The State of Israel has a great variety of archives: governmental, national, public and private. The Israel State Archives are officially authorized to supervise, guide and administer the archives of government institutions and local authorities. The Israel State Archives also authorize and supervise the country‘s private archives.\r\n",
                "summary": "Israeli archives store important Holocaust-relevant collections. They include vast amounts of personal documentation brought to the country by refugees and survivors of the Holocaust, as well as testimonies given by survivors during and after the war. These testimonies describe the survivors’ experiences in the ghettos, camps, hideaways and with the partisans. It is important to point out that refugees and immigrants in Mandatory Palestine corresponded with relatives still living in their countries of origin. The letters from their relatives contain important information regarding the situation in these countries before and during the Nazi-occupation and the immediate post-war period.\r\n\r\nThe Yad Vashem Archives, whose official activities date back to 1946, holds the largest number of Holocaust-related collections by far. When the Israeli Parliament entrusted Yad Vashem with the mission to commemorate the Shoah and its victims in 1953, Yad Vashem began to systematically collect Holocaust-related documentation from all kinds of sources.\r\n\r\nThe first documents arrived at Yad Vashem from the “Historical Commissions” and various documentation centres established after the war, mostly by Holocaust survivors, but also from public institutions, researchers and private individuals. Material collected in Israel was added to the documentation collected by Jews during the war in the ghettos, camps and hideaways, as well as materials collected in the first years after the war, for example in DP camps. Since its establishment, the Yad Vashem Archives have initiated activities with a view to collecting and copying Holocaust-related documents that have been housed in various archives in Europe and throughout the world. Over the years, they have collected extensive and comprehensive documentation in various forms. For more detailed information on the activities and holdings of the Yad Vashem Archives, see the extensive report.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Yad Vashem, the Ghetto Fighters House, the Massuah Institute for the Study of the Holocaust, the Moreshet Mordechai Anielevich Memorial and the Kiddush Hashem Archive are important institutions that hold and collect Holocaust-related sources. Historically, these institutions were connected to different political movements. Furthermore, the Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People, the National Library of Israel, the Wiener Library for the Study of the Nazi Era and the Holocaust at Tel Aviv University, the Central Zionist Archives, the Jabotinsky Institute in Israel, Beit Theresienstadt, and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee should be mentioned here. Many more institutions in Israel hold Holocaust-related archives, such as the Leo Baeck Institute and the Lavon Institute for Labour Research. For more information on these institutions, see the extensive report. \r\n\r\nFinally, official documentation from the British authorities in Mandatory Palestine can be found in Israel, as well as documentation from Jewish organizations and public institutions of that period. These sources reflect the many ways in which immigrants arrived in Mandatory Palestine, and the hardships they endured, but also rescue attempts undertaken by both individual and political or public institutions.",
                "extensive": "Disclaimer: The EHRI Extensive Report was updated in 2024.\r\n\r\n**A. EHRI approach to Israel: Pre-existing research and third-party surveys, archival guides and expert support**\r\n\r\nIn Israel, EHRI was able to rely on and cooperate with Israel Archives Network, or RE'I Project of the National Library and State Archives in Israel which in 2013 conducted a survey, under the auspices of the Prime Minister's Office, to identify and map most archives in Israel. In the process, information was collected on archives holding Holocaust-related material, as well as on the documentation itself. The RE'I Project aimed at building an infrastructure, creating uniform standards for the archives in Israel, ensuring proper maintenance of documentation in various archives in Israel, and granting easy archival access to the public in Israel.\r\n\r\nThe RE’I Project has established that there are some 600 archives in Israel. Whether they hold Holocaust-relevant sources, and to what extent, was largely unknown before.\r\n\r\nIn the first implementation stage of the RE’I Project, a survey was conducted in all the archives that had been designated by the project steering committee. Surveyors were recruited to visit the various archives and to conduct an online survey via a dedicated survey system provided by Ransys Feedback Technologies. The survey was conducted over the course of a year. At the start of the survey, a list of 350 archives was available.\r\n\r\nCooperation between EHRI and RE'I, which was facilitated by Yad Vashem and started in the planning stages of the survey, allowed for the insertion of questions relating to the existence of Holocaust-related materials in the archives to be surveyed. The questions were designed to ascertain whether or not any Holocaust-related documentation existed in a particular archive; the nature of the documentation (personal documents, official documents, testimonies, memoirs); and the number of relevant collections in the archive. Likewise, the archives were asked to briefly describe the relevant collections and to provide their signatures.\r\n\r\nAbout 200 of the archives surveyed responded that they had Holocaust-related documentation. A large number of the archives also mentioned the types of existing documentation in their possession. Only a few, however, responded to questions regarding the number of relevant collections and their signatures. It appears that the reason for this is that many of the archives in Israel do not use the practice of registering documentation at the collection level, but rather at the file level. Another reason is the fact that some of the documentation is dispersed in files or collections pertaining to other topics. This hinders the identification and description of the documentation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, most of the relevant information gained from the RE'I survey pertains to the identification of Israeli archives holding various types of Holocaust-related material. In some cases there is also a very general description of the documentation. For the most part, it is difficult to extract quantitative data, collection signatures or detailed descriptions from the survey. Some of the archives are already included in the EHRI portal. More detailed information on the documentation in some of the archives, and its inclusion in the EHRI portal, will be possible once the archives become accessible in the framework of the RE'I project and the data is imported.\r\n\r\nBelow are examples of data provided by archives that participated in the survey, regarding Holocaust-related documentation in their possession. These examples represent the various types of archives in Israel: municipal or community archives – cities, communal settlements (moshavim), kibbutzim; archives of public and private organisations, institutions and political parties; and archives dedicated to a specific topic.\r\n\r\nMoshav and kibbutz archives primarily hold personal documentation of past and present members, refugees and Holocaust survivors, which is often kept in their personal files. The most prevalent types of documentation in these archives are testimonies and memoirs. Some of the archives have reported that the relevant material is scattered among various files and difficult to identify.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that some of the kibbutz and moshav members and some of the archives in these locations have submitted the originals or copies of the documentation in their possession to archives that primarily collect Holocaust-related documentation, such as Lohamei Haghetaot, Yad Ya'ari, Masuah and Moreshet. For example, the Yad Vashem Archives contain record group O.90 which includes documentation collected from kibbutzim. Since the survey did not include a question relating to original vs. copied documentation, it is difficult to say how much of the documentation is original. It should also be noted that some of the archives included information on Holocaust commemoration in their reports on Holocaust-related documentation.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- Kibbutz Beit Hashita archive – 50 items. Testimonies of survivors and orphans adopted by the kibbutz. There is also material on the absorption of youth groups and groups that were trained in the kibbutz and went on to establish other kibbutzim.\r\n- Kfar Yehoshua archive – requests for certificates; documentation of the youth groups that arrived from Germany and Romania, documentation in members' personal files.\r\n- Kibbutz Hafetz Haim archive – 16 files. Testimonies of kibbutz members, most of whom were Holocaust survivors.\r\n- Kibbutz Mayanot archive – 25 testimonies; letters of Yosef Kaplan, Shomer Hatzair emissary in Warsaw, who perished in the Holocaust and who corresponded with kibbutz members; documentation on Haviva Reich and other kibbutz members.\r\n- Kibbutz Hatzerim archive – 60 items. File on the Teheran children; information on kibbutz members who were Holocaust survivors.\r\n- Yad Ya'ari Hashomer Hatzair Archive – about 20 collections, including Hashomer Hatzair in Poland; Hashomer Hatzair in Yugoslavia; the bureau in Paris; Hashomer Hatzair worldwide; personal collections of Abba Kovner, Shalom Cholawski, Chaika Grossman, the sculptor Nathan Rapoport.\r\n- Machon Lavon Labor Movement Archive – 2 collections. The Hehalutz liaison office in Geneva - Nathan Schwalb (Dror) archive; collection of certificates from the Holocaust period.\r\n- Maccabee Archive – personal stories of athletes from Vilna who were banned from the 1936 Olympics by the Nazi regime.\r\n- Yad Chaim Weizmann Archive – correspondence regarding requests for rescue and aid and memos describing the situation of the Jews in Europe.\r\n- Felicia Blumental Music Center archive – Huberman archive: personal correspondence of Bronislaw Huberman regarding the Nazi rise to power in Germany in the framework of a pan-European movement and correspondence with the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler regarding the banishment of Jews from cultural life in Germany due to the antisemitic policies of the Nazis.\r\n- Leo Baeck Institute for the Study of German and Central European Jewry archive – unknown number of unique and rare letters, diaries and personal testimonies from the Holocaust period.\r\n- Hebrew University archive – There is not an exact number of items. Pre-war acceptance applications from individuals who anticipated the future and attempted to escape from Europe; diplomas awarded to students; documentation of project \"Treasures of the Diaspora\": campaign to salvage materials during the war, especially towards its end in 1945 and afterwards, when it was possible to move freely in those areas. The university sent missions to salvage materials, books and archives of Jewish communities in Europe. The administrative documentation that was produced during the campaign is found in the archive and the materials themselves are today in the National Library and the Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Israeli archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nMany archives in Israel contain a great deal of personal documentation, created or preserved by victims and survivors of the Holocaust, which reflects their experiences. Refugees and survivors had or have a variety of personal papers in their possession which reflect their experiences before, during and after the Shoah. They also document their histories and the events they witnessed in their former places of residence in Europe. A large portion of this material has been deposited and new material continues to arrive at various archives throughout Israel.\r\n\r\nAn increasing awareness of the great importance of Holocaust-era personal documentation held by private individuals in Israel has led the archives of Yad Vashem and the Ghetto Fighters' House in recent years to appeal to the Israeli public to deposit such documentation in their archives. These campaigns have resulted in the addition of thousands of items, mostly original documents, to the archives' collections.\r\n\r\nThe Yad Vashem Law, enacted by the Israeli Parliament in 1953, defined the institution’s mission as “to collect, examine and publish testimony of the disaster and the heroism it called forth…”, thus commemorating the Shoah and its victims. As a result, the Yad Vashem Archives were established which have collected Holocaust-related documentation from various sources ever since. However, efforts to document the Holocaust had begun long before 1953. From the Nazi rise to power in Germany, and throughout the Second World War, people documented the events as they were taking place, often under the harshest conditions. Even before the enormity of the disaster became clear, Mordechai Shenhavi initiated a Commemorative Project for the Jews of Europe that would include an archive. The Yad Vashem Archives officially started operating in 1946, under the direction of Dr. Sarah Friedlander, who had been born in Budapest and saved on the Kasztner train. The first documents arrived at Yad Vashem from the “Historical Commissions” and various documentation centres, as well as public institutions, researchers and private individuals. Material collected in Israel was added to the documentation collected by Jews during the war in the ghettos, camps and hideaways. Immediately after the war, centres for documentation and the collection of testimonies were established in many places around the world, including Munich, Warsaw, Lodz, Lublin, Paris, Bratislava, Budapest and other locations.\r\n\r\nSince their establishment, the Yad Vashem Archives have initiated activities with a view to collecting and copying Holocaust-related documents that have been housed in various archives in Europe and throughout the world. With the fall of the “Iron Curtain” and the opening of archives in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s, the reproduction project has been greatly expanded.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results in Israel**\r\n\r\nAfter decades of collecting Holocaust-relevant sources and original research in the field, Yad Vashem is clearly the most important record-holding institution in Israel. With over 210,000,000 pages of documentation it stores the largest collection of Holocaust documents in the world. The collections include over 131,000 survivor testimonies; over 500,000 photographs and approximately 4.8 million names registered in the Hall of Names.\r\n\r\nIt was crucial to include collection data held by Yad Vashem in the EHRI portal. In EHRI’s first phase, It was decided to divide the work into two steps. In the first step, descriptions of record groups and sub-record groups existing in the Yad Vashem database were manually added to the EHRI portal. Alongside the addition of the descriptions to the portal, dozens of authority entries were developed – especially personalities and organizations – which were later linked to the appropriate collection descriptions. In the second step, we added about 47 record groups and sub-record groups comprising 11,000 units of description in an IT-driven integration process.\r\n\r\nIn EHRI’s second phase, the export activity of Yad Vashem had two goals. Firstly, EHRI wanted to update Yad Vashem’s existing content on the EHRI portal, improve the quality of the descriptions and add new records. Secondly, the goal was to have a sustainable connection between Yad Vashem and the EHRI portal, allowing content updates and additions of new material on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, an additional 45 record groups, which have an internal hierarchical structure, have been exported to the portal. There were several challenges in the export process, including the definition of the export structure and standardization of the data; development of new workflows while bearing in mind that they should be designed to allow automatization in the future; and the creation of a new service in the Yad Vashem digital infrastructure for publishing data in a sustainable way.\r\n\r\nThe team used the EAD conversion tool provided by EHRI to create the EAD files as it allows for the creation of the EADs in a way which is consistent with the constraints requested by the EHRI project.\r\n\r\nThe EAD records were published using the Metadata Publication Tool provided by EHRI. This tool allows exposure of the EAD records for harvesting. The export was done in two languages, Hebrew and English, and is available in the portal. During EHRI-3, and following the changes to the data integration infrastructure introduced during this phase, the data exchange workflow was further sustained by the development of a bespoke API by YV, ensuring future updates of their archival descriptions. More than 1,400 additional record groups have been exported to the portal. Currently, the record groups are being linked to the corresponding record groups in other institutions present on the EHRI portal, since most of these record groups are copied collections acquired by the Yad Vashem archive.  \r\n\r\nApart from Yad Vashem there are many other repositories in Israel that hold Holocaust-related documentation and collect materials on this subject. Such archives include (in a non-exhaustive fashion):\r\n\r\n*American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, Jerusalem Branch*\r\n\r\nFounded during the First World War, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) was the first Jewish organisation in the United States to dispense large-scale funding for international relief. In its wake, the First World War had sown the seeds of many additional catastrophes—pogroms, epidemics, famine, revolution, and economic ruin—and JDC played a major role in rebuilding the devastated communities of Eastern Europe and Mandatory Palestine. JDC’s relief activities, emigration aid, and rescue operations critically followed the Nazi rise to power and the outbreak of the Second World War. After the war, JDC supported and resettled survivors and help rebuild the remnant Jewish communities of Europe. The JDC Archives house one of the most significant collections in the world for the study of modern Jewish history. The JDC Archives are located in two centres, one at JDC’s New York headquarters and the second in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n*Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People*\r\n\r\nThe Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People (CAHJP), established in 1939, is now a subsidiary of the National Library of Israel. This archive includes millions of pages of original and copied documentation related to Jewish communities, including information about those communities before, during, and after World War II. For instance, they hold 1,600 archives of hundreds of Jewish communities, local, national and international Jewish organisations and private collections of many outstanding Jewish personalities. Today, this archive contains the most extensive collection of documents, pinkassim (registers) and other records of Jewish history from the Middle Ages to the present day.\r\n\r\n*Central Zionist Archives*\r\n\r\nThe Zionist Archives were founded in 1919 in Berlin. With the rise to power of the Nazis in 1933, the Archives were transferred to the Jewish Agency building in Jerusalem. Over the years, the collections expanded and after the Second World War an increased effort was made to bring the scarce archival material that had survived the war to Israel. In 1956, the 24th Zionist Congress declared the Central Zionist Archives to be the historic archives of the Zionist Movement, of the World Zionist Organization and of the Jewish Agency. The Central Zionist Archives act as the historic archives of the World Zionist Organization, the Jewish Agency, the Jewish National Fund, the United Israel Appeal and the World Jewish Congress. In addition, they hold archives of organisations and institutions of the Jewish population in the Land of Israel, as well as 1,500 personal archives, including on the heads and leaders of the Zionist Movement and the national funds and various personalities who have been active in the Zionist movement.\r\n\r\n*Ganzach Kiddush Hashem Archive*\r\n\r\nThe Kiddush Hashem Archive (in Hebrew, Ganzach Kiddush Hashem), an Orthodoxy-affiliated Holocaust institution, was founded in 1964 by the Holocaust researcher Rabbi Moshe Prager \"with the aim of commemorating the destroyed Jewish world, the heroism of the Jewish soul during the Holocaust, and the miracle of the Jewish People’s rebirth in Israel\". For 60 years the archive has gathered about 300,000 photographs in the Photograph Archive, about 2,000,000 documents in the Document Archive, approximately 40,000 textbooks in the Library as well as about 2000 video testimonies.\r\n\r\n*Ghetto Fighters' House*\r\n\r\nThe Ghetto Fighters' House – Itzhak Katzenelson Holocaust and Jewish Resistance Heritage Museum, an institution historically affiliated with the Zionist Labour movement, was founded in 1949 by a community of Holocaust survivors, members of the Jewish underground in the ghettos of Poland, and veterans of partisan units, to be a place of testimony that would tell the story of the Jewish People in the 20th century in general, and during the Second World War in particular. At the centre of this chronicle are the manifestations of Jewish resistance: the organised uprisings of Jews in the ghettos and camps, and the Jews who fought in partisan units and the armies of the Allied forces. The Ghetto Fighters’ House archive holds over 2,500,000 objects, including letters, certificates, diaries and testimonies (written, audio and video), films, photographs and displays. The archive collections comprise the history of the Jewish nation on all five continents during the first half of the 20th century and cover a wide range of areas such as the spiritual life, traditions and religion, society, education, economics, Holocaust and resistance, and the nation’s revival in the Land of Israel.\r\n\r\n*Jabotinsky Institute in Israel*\r\n\r\nThe Jabotinsky Institute in Israel was founded in 1937 with the aim of collecting and serving as a repository for documents, publications and photographic material associated with Ze'ev Jabotinsky and the Revisionist Movement. Today, about 400 personal archives of Ze'ev Jabotinsky and his family are stored in the Institute, as well as archives of the leaders of the Revisionist Movement. In addition, the collection includes 215 archives relating to the various branches of the National Movement and its institutions such as the Union of Zionists Revisionists (Hatzohar); The New Zionist Organization (N.Z.O); The Betar Youth movement and its Israeli and international branches; The National Labor Federation; and Keren Tel-Hai.\r\n\r\n*Massuah Institute for the Study of the Holocaust*\r\n\r\nThe Massuah Institute, an institution historically affiliated with the Zionist liberal Progressive Party, contains a museum and an international seminar centre designed to evoke discourse on the significance of the Holocaust in our contemporary society and culture. The Document Archive comprises a collection of documents and publications related to the Holocaust, the Jewish world prior to the Holocaust – community institutions, youth movements and collections of personal documents. It is the chief archive of the history of the Hanoar Hazioni and Akiva youth movements. The documents are arranged according to subject in 12 units. Among them are unique collections of postal items from the time of the Holocaust, personal testimonies of Holocaust survivors and personal archives.\r\n\r\n*Moreshet*\r\n\r\nEstablished in 1961, Moreshet, Mordechai Anielevich Memorial Holocaust Study and Research Centre, affiliated with the Hashomer Hatzair movement, is dedicated to the commemoration of Jewish organised resistance during the Second World War and the Holocaust. The Moreshet archive holds a vast body of testimonies – personal and collective, collected in the years following the liberation and later on. The unique documents preserved in the Moreshet archive include many documents relating to the underground movement that operated in the Vilna ghetto, the pioneer underground in Hungary, documentation of the Slovakian revolt and other documents about the support and rescue of Jewish refugees during and after the war. Another interesting section in the archive is a collection of more than a hundred personal war diaries, which give a direct insight into the experiences and feelings of their writers. Finally, it holds a fascinating collection of arts and craft works that survived the war.\r\n\r\n*National Library of Israel*\r\n\r\nThe National Library of Israel includes a growing number of collections, such as but not limited to:\r\n- A nearly complete collection of secondary literature on the Holocaust in tens of languages\r\n- Archives of individual cultural heroes, artists, scholars, and authors who perished in the Holocaust, emigrated or fled due to rising European anti-Semitism, survived the Holocaust, or created art and culture related to the Holocaust (including documents from Stefan Zweig, Avraham Sutzkever and the cultural life in the Vilna Ghetto, Anita Shapira, and others)\r\n- Archival material related to the Land of Israel during WWII and Jewish Soldiers during the war, as well as the relocation of survivors to Palestine and later the State of Israel\r\n- Several oral history collections and ethnographic recordings related to the Holocaust and its survivors, particularly but not exclusively materials gathered by the Oral History Division of the Hebrew University\r\n- A music collection that includes thousands of recordings of Holocaust related music\r\n- Collections of published material by and for the She'erit Hapelatah, including ritual texts, newspapers, children's books, and others, including a complete set of the Survivors' Talmud \r\n- Several diaries of Holocaust survivors, including that of Menachem Oppenheim written in the margins of his prayer book\r\n- The Historical Jewish Press site, includes hundreds of thousands of pages of full-text searchable Jewish newspapers from Europe and around the world from the 1930s and 1940s\r\n- Meta-data about some of the items in the collections that were distributed by Jewish Cultural Reconstruction\r\n- The USC Shoah Foundation (USC SFI) has partnered with the National Library of Israel to provide Israeli users with the first countrywide access to USC SFI's entire Visual History Archive, including testimonies from more than 52,000 Holocaust survivors and hundreds of survivors of the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks\r\n\r\n*Beith Theresienstadt*\r\n\r\nBeit Terezin archives contain original documents in addition to photocopies of documents stored in other institutions, all pertaining to the ghetto period, and including a catalogue listing details of about 160,000 prisoners of Ghetto Theresienstadt. Over 900 files are classified under topics such as: art, literature, self-administration, medicine, labor department, children’s homes, children’s comics, music, academic studies, research, personal testimonies, and biographical information.\r\n\r\nAn integral part of the archive is the library which contains about 5,000 books, periodicals, catalogues, sheets of music composed and performed in the ghetto, documentary films, audio recordings, in Hebrew and other languages.\r\n\r\nThe world’s largest collection of drawings, paintings and sculptures created by adults and children while they were interned in Ghetto Theresienstadt is perhaps the “backbone” of the archive, and also includes Judaica objects and everyday objects.\r\n\r\n*The Wiener Library for the Study of the Nazi era and the Holocaust at Tel Aviv University*\r\n\r\nThe Wiener Library for the Study for the Study of the Nazi Era and the Holocaust is a steadily growing research library and comprises old and new publications on the Third Reich, during and between the two world wars, Jewish communities in Europe, the Holocaust, anti-Semitism, and fascism throughout the world. As a research library affiliated to the Sourasky Central Library of Tel Aviv University, it offers access to extensive archival sources, books, journals, and databases for researchers worldwide. The library continues to develop and enhance its collections, provides guidance in retrieving information and locating material, initiates conferences, seminars and lecture series, encourages and coordinates research projects, and collaborates with scholars, research institutes, archives and other research libraries.\r\n\r\n*Shem Olam, Faith and the Holocaust Institute for Education Documentation and Research*\r\n\r\nThe Shem Olam Institute has harnessed itself and others to carry out research using historical scientific tools, while uncovering documents and unfamiliar sources relating to the world of values, faith, religious and spiritual life, which focus attention on coping in the Holocaust. \r\n\r\nThe EHRI Portal furthermore provides collection descriptions from the Leo Baeck Institute and other institutions.

Of course the fate of these communities was much better than that of European Jewry, but that is not a sufficient reason to ignore the plight of Jews who suffered the loss of a family member in labor camps and internment camps, or deportation to concentration camps in Europe, the exploitation of children in forced labor, expropriation of property, houses destroyed by aerial bombardment, the humiliation of being forced to wear a yellow badge and the constant uncertainty of what the future would bring.\r\n \r\nThe Center for Information, Documentation and Research on North-African Jewry during World War II, which operates under the auspices of the Ben-Zvi Institute in Jerusalem, was established in 2006 with the support of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims against Germany, with the purpose of making information on this subject available, raising the public consciousness and awareness of the travails of Jews in North Africa, developing curricula and training teachers to incorporate the subject in the Israeli school system and to advance academic research.\r\n \r\nThe Center is setting up a database on the internet that will be available to the general public and researchers and will enable them to obtain information through thousands of indexed documents from archives in Israel and abroad on North-African Jewry during WWII. This database will be part of a website that will include, chronology, bibliography, information on conferences and publications, interactive learning, options for depositing source material and a forum for researchers and teachers.\r\n \r\nIt is of paramount importance to obtain the testimonies of Jews from North Africa living in Israel and abroad who experienced World War II. Because of advanced age of the potential witnesses the staff of the center is cooperating with other institutions in this area in order to reach the greatest number of people and record their stories while it is still possible."

That was the reason why they chose to set up a kibbutz on the northern reaches of Palestine. The kibbutz was first named “Bar Giora” after the organization Bar Giora, whose members had set up the Hashomer movement. In 1918, after the death of Israel Giladi, the leader of the movement, it was decided to name the settlement after him: Kfar Giladi."

From its inception, Mapai, which was a Zionist Socialist party, became the main political entity in the Jewish settlements in Palestine. It also headed the largest labor union, the Histadrut (General Federation of Labor) as well as the Jewish Agency and the Haganah defense forces.\r\n\r\nMapai, and as of 1968 the Labor Party (Avodah), remained at the forefront of the State until 1977, forming the basis for every successive government.

Through the years other persons joined the leadership of the party, among them Levi Eshkol, Pinhas Lavon, Pinhas Sapir, Moshe Dayan, Abba Eban, Shimon Peres, Yigal Alon, Israel Galili and Yitzhak Rabin. \r\n\r\nOn May 24, 1963, the party Secretariat decided to establish the archive, whose main function would be to serve as a repository for all archival material of the party, beginning with the meetings of the Joint Secretariat of Achdut Ha’avoda and Hapoel Hatzair in 1929, as well as correspondence and publications of the Ichud Olami. \r\nThe Moshe Sharett Labor Party Archive was founded in 1965 as part of the Berl Katznelson Foundation, and was recognized by the government of Israel as a public archive, subject to the stipulations of the Archives Law. The source materials of this historical, administrative and documentational archive reflect the history of the party and of other organizations to this day. \r\n"

With the rise to power of the Nazis in 1933, the Archives was transferred to the Jewish Agency building in Jerusalem. Over the years, its collections expanded, and after the Second World War, an increased effort was made to bring the scarce archival material that survived the war to Israel. In 1956, the 24th Zionist Congress declared the Central Zionist Archives to be the historic archives of the Zionist Movement, of the World Zionist Organization, and of the Jewish Agency. It was also resolved that all the offices of the World Zionist Organization and the Jewish Agency in Israel and in the Diaspora would be obligated to transfer the files, that are no longer necessary for ongoing work, to the Archives.In 1987, a new building was inaugurated for the Archives. All the material that was in part preserved in external storehouses was transferred for storage to the new building. The spacious reading room began serving scholars and others. In the 1990s, the Archives began to computerize its large database, and subsequently to convert part of its collections to digital media. In 2004, the first website of the Archives was inaugurated. In the 2000s, the Archives decided to develop the field of genealogy. The Archives absorbed appropriate collections, and began to enable the general public to send requests to receive information about their family members."

It forms part of the Hitachdut Oley Yugoslavia (Association of Jewish immigrants from Yugoslavia).

The Archives consist of 115 indexed archival boxes, a library and a collection of photographs. They also hold a set of pre-Holocaust Jewish periodicals published in Yugoslavia. The holdings are roughly divided into the following three main categories: 1) Communal and Zionist entities, 2) papers and notes on subjects of Jewish concern, 3) personal files (including ketubot, diplomas and genealogical data). They include some original material, correspondence, photocopies of official and internal sources, mostly concerning pre-Holocaust events, some of them pertaining to the 19th century. There are files which contain evidence on personalities, rabbis, economic and social activities and information regarding Jewish participation in patriotic wars, and, particularly, in the anti-Fascist partisan movement during World War II. They also hold records and notes on archeological sites of the ancient period (1st-3rd centuries) as well as catalogues and publications on the medieval site of Čelarevo, near Bačka Palanka."

Unknowingly, his work formed the basis of realizing the 1933 resolution of the movement's Central Institution to establish an archive — to be called the \"Betar Museum\" — to serve as the official repository of the movement's publications. \r\nThe Institute's beginnings were quite humble: From its first home in the laboratory of Kupat Holim Leumit (the Leumit Sick Fund) on 44 Nachlat Benyamin St., Tel Aviv, it moved to the basement of the “Metzuda” on King George Street, until finally reaching the present location on the first floor of Beit Jabotinsky. \r\nIn 1947, shortly before the British authorities outlawed Betar, Pa’amoni and friends decided to change the name of the \"Betar Museum\" to \"The Jabotinsky Institute,\" thus saving the museum and its collections from confiscation by the CID (British Intelligence). \r\nIn 1958, the Jabotinsky Institute's archive was recognized as a Public Historical Archive, in accordance with the Archives’ Law (1955). \r\nThrough the years, the Institute has grown to include a state-of-the-art museum, open to the public, and an impressive program of study days and seminars attracting growing numbers of audiences. To broaden its scope, the Institute has undertaken an ongoing commitment to initiating research, publishing books, and other activities of national and international status. Recently, Institute has completed the first phase of the monumental project to upload the archive’s million documents onto the Internet.\r\nThe Jabotinsky Institute is a registered Israeli non-profit organization (Amutah number 580028736.) \r\nChairmen of the Institute who succeeded Pa’amoni are, in chronological order: \r\nMoshe Himmelfarb z”l (1952-1958); Alexander Gurewitz z”l (1958-1963); Yehuda Ben-Ari z’l (1964-1980); Ben-Zion Keshet z”l (1981-1984), Dr. Ely Tavin z”l (1984-1994); and Peleg Tamir z\"l (1994-2011)."

Our collection of more than 10,000 interviews in 20 languages constitutes a unique treasure of Jewish memories whose importance cannot be underestimated. The collection includes testimonies on the Holocaust that were conducted in the early 1960s, when the reservoir of survivors (especially those who were adults during the war) was much larger and their memories less affected by the passage of time. Interviews were also conducted with key individuals involved in the Zionist movement, and other organizations such as the United Jewish Appeal, as well as with men and women who grew up under the British mandate in Palestine, under Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, or in various Jewish communities throughout the world."

Upon Einstein's death in 1955, Dr. Nathan devoted himself tirelessly for more than a quarter of a century to the administration of the Estate of Albert Einstein. In close cooperation with the co-Trustee of the Estate, Ms. Helen Dukas, Dr. Nathan succeeded in tripling the size of the Albert Einstein Archives during the period 1955-1982. As Executor to Einstein's writings, Dr. Nathan cooperated with numerous publishers throughout the world in the publication in a wide variety of languages of many new editions of Einstein's works. Dr. Nathan shared Einstein's leftist views on politics and society - this affinity led to his editing (in collaboration with Heinz Norden) a selection of Einstein's writings on pacifism entitled Einstein on Peace in 1960. Dr. Nathan also laid a substantial part of the groundwork for the historical edition of The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein. In 1982, the Estate of Albert Einstein transferred all the literary rights to Einstein's writings to The Hebrew University of Jerusalem - in accordance with Einstein's Will of 1950. During the period of 1982-1990, the American Friends of the Hebrew University (AFHU) in New York were responsible for dealing with all copyright issues pertaining to Einstein's writings. This work was carried out meticulously and conscientiously by the late Ehud Benamy of the AFHU, under the sagacious guidance of the late Prof. Milton Handler. In 1991, the Executive of The Hebrew University in Jerusalem decided to transfer responsibility for all copyright issues pertaining to Albert Einstein to the office of the Curator of the Albert Einstein Archives in Jerusalem.

The idea of establishing Massuah began taking shape in the early 1960s and came from two directons; one began with the conference on heroism that was held at Kibbutz Tel Yitzhak on the Holocaust Remembrance Day, initiated by kibbutz members, some of whom were Holocaust survivors. Additional initiators were members of Hanoar Hazioni who came from Zaglebie in western Poland. These members, called Nasha Groupa (our group), managed to escape Poland through Slovakia and Hungary in the midst of the Holocaust. Members of Nasha Groupa and members of Tel Yitzhak decided to establish a center and an amphitheater for events in the kibbutz. The cornerstone was laid in May 1965. The objective of the founders was to establish a memorial center for members of these movements. The prominent figure among the group members was Fredka Mazya. Unlike her contemporaries, Mazya envisioned a institution devoted chiefly to educational work and not the party, one that would hold in-depth seminars, whose objective would be to bring young people in Israel and throughout the world closer to the subject of the Holocaust and its meaning, and not concentrate on establishing a memorial site for members of one youth movement alone. The initiators managed to secure a budget for building the museum with the help of the then minister, Moshe Kol. The new institution began work in 1972, as an international seminar center, which includes a museum, an educational center, and archival center for the movement."

The DGA works under the Italian Ministry of Culture - MIC (https://cultura.gov.it/). The DGA leads and supervises an extended network of public institutions, which includes:\r\n- the Italian Central Institute for the Archives [Istituto centrale per gli Archivi – ICAR] which promotes and supports the enhancement of the archival heritage through thematic projects and ICT development;\r\n- the Central State Archives [Archivio Centrale dello Stato - ACS] in Rome, which preserve documentation created by the central political and administrative bodies of the State, including the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, ministries, judicial and advisory bodies;\r\n- 19 Regional Archival Superintendencies [Soprintendenze Archivistiche]: Every Region has a “Soprintendenza Archivistica” or in some cases a “Soprintendenza archivistica e bibliografica).

                "summary": "EHRI has so far identified over 90 archival institutions which hold Holocaust-relevant resources in Italy. These institutions can be roughly divided into public institutions such as the City Archives [Archivi Comunali], the State Archives (Archivi di Stato), the [Central State Archive [Archivio Centrale dello Stato]](https://www.esercito.difesa.it/storia/Ufficio-Storico-SME), the [Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [Archivio del Ministero degli Affari Esteri]](https://www.esteri.it/it/uapsds/archivio-storico-e-biblioteca/archivio-storico-diplomatico/), and the [Archives of the Army General Staff [Archivio Storico dell’Esercito]](https://www.esercito.difesa.it/storia/Ufficio-Storico-SME). The Archives of the Army General Staff allows limited access only. Furthermore, there are private archives such as the Parish and Diocesan Archives [Archivi Parrocchiali e Diocesani, which belong to the Catholic Church] and the Archives of the Jewish Communities [Archivi delle Comunità Ebraiche] of which the Rome, Florence and Venice branches hold particularly significant Holocaust-related collections. The Institutes for the History of the Resistance Movement network [Istituti per la storia della Resistenza], which has a [central seat in Milan](https://www.reteparri.it/) and a leading institute in Turin, holds records on the period 1943-1945 and focuses on documenting anti-fascist activity. The leading archive for documents concerning anti-Jewish persecutions in Italy is the Foundation Jewish Contemporary Documentation Center [CDEC, Fondazione Centro di Documentazione Ebraica Contemporanea] in Milan. The Center has produced the most detailed database documenting the history of the Italian Jews during the Holocaust period, which is now also available online (see below). [The National Museum of Italian Jewry and the Shoah [Museo Nazionale dell’Ebraismo Italiano e della Shoah, MEIS]](https://meis.museum/) in Ferrara and the Museum of the Shoah [Museo della Shoah] in Rome, are under construction and, for this reason, have not yet been the object of EHRI’s survey work.\r\n\r\nOutside of Italy, EHRI found that the State Archives in Rijeka, Croatia, have four collections pertaining to the Holocaust period. Especially important, however, are the vast holdings on Italy, which EHRI was able to identify at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.",
                "extensive": "Disclaimer: The EHRI Extensive Report was updated in 2024.\r\n\r\n**A. EHRI approach to Italy: Pre-existing research, archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nLacking a pre-existing specific, thematic guide about Holocaust documentation in Italy, the EHRI approach to Italy was based on two pillars. The first focused on the collections held by the Foundation Jewish Contemporary Documentation Center (CDEC). The bulk of research on the Holocaust in Italy has been carried out by the scholars of this institution, which began collecting documents in the 1960s and now holds a large number of copy collections from many of the Italian State Archives. These fragments have been used as a directory for deeper investigation in their originating institutions. The second pillar focused on research concerning the persecution of the Jews in Italy.\r\n\r\nGeneral guides to the Italian archival heritage are available on both paper and in digital format. See, for example, the *General Guide to the State Archives* [*Guida generale degli Archivi di Stato*, a cura di Claudio Pavone, Piero D’Angiolini, Roma, 1966-1969], which is also available online through a dedicated platform where information can be easily searched: http://www.guidageneralearchivistato.beniculturali.it/\r\n\r\nAs for the diocesan archives, a useful paper guide has been published as a special issue of the Journal *Rassegna degli Archivi di Stato in 1998. See, Guida degli Archivi diocesan d’Italia*, a cura di V. Monachino, E. Boaga, L. Osbat, S. Palese, Roma, Ministero per i beni culturali e ambientali. Ufficio centrale per i Beni Archivistici, 1998.\r\n\r\nThe Central State Archives provides access to interviews from the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education with Italian Holocaust survivors, available through the online portal Ti racconto la storia: voci dalla Shoah: http://www.shoah.acs.beniculturali.it/.\"\r\n\r\nEHRI has found the web portal of the Archival Superintendencies, Sistema Informativo Unificato per le Soprintendenze Archivistiche (SIUSA) particularly useful for navigating the archives of local Jewish communities: http://siusa.archivi.beniculturali.it/. In particular, it is worth mentioning that there is athe  thematic section devoted to the Archives for the Jewish history (Archivi per la storia dell’ebraismo):  https://siusa-archivi.cultura.gov.it/cgi-bin/siusa/pagina.pl?RicProgetto=ebrais\r\n\r\nOn the SIUSA web portal, there is also a useful “Guide to Archives of the Resistance” [Guida agli Archivi della Resistenza]: http://siusa.archivi.beniculturali.it/cgi-bin/pagina.pl?TipoPag=strumcorr&Chiave=27763. As for the numerous collections of the Institutes for the History of the Resistance, their collections can be browsed through an integrated web portal at: http://www.reteparri.it/patrimonio/\r\n\r\nApart from SIUSA, other databases and web-portals that have been useful in the identification of Holocaust-relevant archival institutions and collections include Sistema Archivistico Nazionale – http://san.beniculturali.it – as well as Sistema Informativo degli Archivi di Stato (SIAS): http://sias.archivi.beniculturali.it/cgi-bin/pagina.pl?RicVM=archivi\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Italian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAs a systematic cataloguing of Holocaust-related material scattered throughout Italian archival institutions has not yet been done at a national nor local level, a good knowledge of the history of the Italian administrative bodies together with authoritative historiographical works can help in the task of the identification of Holocaust related material. High and medium level archival descriptions – in some cases also full inventories – of the documentation held by the wide network of public and private institutions in Italy are available online thanks to an integrated and continuously updated web portal, the National Archival System [Sistema Archivistico Nazionale, SAN]. It works as a national access point to information on archival resources . However, these descriptions are often insufficient to identify the collections within which Holocaust-related documentation is present. For example, the Central State Archives in Rome hold a large amount of documentation about all aspects of persecution of the Jews, but this is only partially reported in both the online and paper finding aids. The same goes for the State Archives, where scholars can definitely find useful documentation in the “Questura” and “Prefettura” fonds, even though the finding aids do not always mention the presence of this kind of material.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is important to note that there have been a number of initiatives and projects aimed to make material and documentation about the Holocaust accessible to a wider audience in recent years. For example, the State Archives of Venice are digitising documents related to the persecution of the Jews in Venice; the State Archives of Trieste are working on a project aiming to describe and index their Holocaust related documentation (especially those related to the Coroneo prison, which are very important for the identification of the victims arrested and/or deported from Trieste; and the Municipal (or City) Archives of Milan are reordering their collection on the full 1938 Racial census (more than 3,500 papers, which refer to every Jewish family residing in Milan) and are planning to write descriptions for this documentation.\r\n\r\nWhile both the Central State Archives and regional State Archives hold documentation that enables research on the administrative machinery behind the persecution of the Jews, researchers can find material documenting the impact of this persecution from the victims’ perspectives at Jewish institutions and archives. This is the case of the Foundation “Contemporary Jewish Documentation Center” [Fondazione Centro di Documentazione Ebraica Contemporanea, CDEC], whose collections and databases are primarily focused on the personal documents and testimonies of Holocaust victims and partisan Jews. The historical Archives of the Union of the Italian Jewish Community [Unione delle Comunità ebraiche Italiane, UCEI] provides documentation about the reactions of the top Jewish political and administrative management to the Fascist regime, racial laws and persecution, as well post-war policies and activities for rebuilding the Italian Jewish communities after the Holocaust. It also holds relevant documentation about the relationships established with the State administrative bodies. This kind of documentation can be found at the historical archives of almost every Italian Jewish community archive, especially those of the major urban centres – Rome, Milan, Turin, Florence, Venice and Trieste. For these major centres, the principal Jewish institutions and archives are the CDEC Foundation; the Historical Archives of the Jewish Community of Rome (https://ascer.roma.it/); the Carlo and Vera Wagner Museum in Trieste; the Library Archive Renato Maestro in Venice (http://renatomaestro.org/it/); the Benvenuto and Umberto Terracini Archives in Turin (https://www.archivioterracini.it/patrimonio/archivi/); and the Historical Archives of the Jewish Community of Florence (https://www.firenzebraica.it/biblioteca-e-archivio/).\r\n\r\nThe National Museum of Italian Jewry and the Shoah [Museo Nazionale dell’Ebraismo Italiano e della Shoah, MEIS] in Ferrara as well as the Museum of the Shoah [Museo della Shoah] in Rome are under construction and they are still collecting material and documents, while the Memoriale della Shoah in Milan does not collect documents.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these two main categories of archival institutions, there is a third, more diverse group of private institutions that offer valuable documentation and information about the Holocaust in Italy. Notably, there is a network of 64 Institutes for the History of the Resistance Movement (Rete degli Istituti per la storia della Resistenza e dell’età contemporanea) spread across Italy and coordinated by the Istituto Nazionale Ferruccio Parri in Milan (formerly the Istituto Nazionale per la Storia del Movimento di Liberazione in Italia). The Archive of the Fondazione Memoria della Deportazione contains extensive materials and documentation on antifascist deportees. There are also numerous Catholic Parish and Diocesan archives. The Istituto Luce Cinecittà, the leading institute for audiovisual materials from the 1920s to the 1960s, holds a rich collection. The historical archives of the former Banca Commerciale Italiana, now part of the Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Group (with archival branches in Milan, Turin, Rome, and Bologna), contain a wealth of documentation related to the confiscation and restitution of Jewish assets, notably the Fondo EGELI (Ente di Gestione e Liquidazione Immobiliare). (https://asisp.intesasanpaolo.com/egeli/archive-fond/egeli). Since 2024, Intesa Sanpaolo's EGELI data have been available in Linked Open Data format at the following link: https://dati-asisp.intesasanpaolo.com/lod/resource/Dataset/BeniEbraici.html.\r\nAdditional documentation concerning EGELI is also available at the Fondazione 1563 Archive in Turin (https://archiviostorico.fondazione1563.it/oggetti/98550-iii-gestioni-egeli-ente-di-gestione-e-liquidazione-immobiliare-dell-istituto-di-san-paolo-di-torino/). Lastly, for insights into Jewish commercial and industrial activities in Italy, the historical archives of local Chambers of Commerce, one in each province, could prove useful.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI Identification and description of results**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Italy**\r\n\r\nAs a result of the identification process in Italy, EHRI has been able to provide descriptions for over 90 institutions. In particular, EHRI began with the identification of collections at the Central State Archives (ACS), local State Archives (AS), and the CDEC Foundation.\r\n\r\nIn general terms, the ACS collections hold documentation concerning the measures taken by the Fascist administration against the Jews while the material held by the local State Archives documents the practical implementation of such measures at the local level. At the Central State Archives, EHRI carried out identification work on the following six collections:\r\n- Ministero degli Interni [Ministry of Interior]\r\n- Ministero delle Finanze [Financial Ministry]\r\n- Ministero della Cultura Popolare [Ministry of Popular Culture]\r\n- Archivi fascisti [Fascist Archives]\r\n- EGELI – Ente Gestione e Liquidazione Immobiliare\r\n- Ministero per l’assistenza post-bellica [Ministry for Post-War Assistance]\r\n\r\nDescribing these collections provides an extensive and multifaceted overview of the material created by ministries and administrative bodies during the Fascist years and after the war. However, given the extent of these collections, the survey and the identification of Holocaust-related material at the ACS is far from complete.\r\n\r\nRegarding the local State Archives, the fonds “Questura” and “Prefettura” of each of the nearly 30 local State Archives which have collection descriptions have been found particularly relevant in documenting the various phases and measures taken by the Fascist regime against the Jews in Italy – Italian and foreigners – from 1938 to 1945.\r\n\r\nThe combination of documentation from the Central State Archives and local State Archives paints a rather detailed picture of how the administrative machine worked at both central and local levels. On the other hand, the documentation imported into the EHRI portal from Jewish institutions and archives – including the Union of the Italian Jewish Communities, several local Jewish Communities and the CDEC Foundation – provides perspectives of those persecuted by the Fascist regime and their reactions to such measures.\r\n\r\nThe CDEC Foundation’s collecting policies have focused on obtaining documentation linked to the persecution of the Jews and Jewish participation in the Resistance. Consequently, the Foundation’s materials focus on individuals and their testimonies about their psychological and physical suffering. From this perspective, the paper collections “Vicissitudini dei singoli”, “CRDE – Comitato Ricerche Deportati Ebrei” and “Massimo Adolfo Vitale” are particularly interesting, as is its photographic collection [“Collezione Fotografie Vittime della Shoah”], and its collection of audio and video interviews [“Testimonianze sulla Shoah”], which the CDEC has been recording since the early 1980s. In addition to the collections cited above, the documents created by the CDEC Foundation on the occasion of the trial (1964-1973) against Friedrich Boßhammer – the Nazi officer responsible for the mass deportation of Jews from Italy – also deserve a special mention. On that occasion, CDEC was in charge of collecting both direct survivor testimonies as well as documentation from several local State Archives in order to assist in the prosecution of Boßhammer. Most of this documentation is now gathered both in the collections “Processo Bosshammer” and “Collezione Archivi Italiani e stranieri”.\r\n\r\nApart from these main lines of inquiry, EHRI has also provided top and medium level descriptions from the Archives of the Union of the Italian Jewish Communities (UCEI) (http://archiviostorico.ucei.it/ucei-web/). The UCEI’s collections give a wide overview of the activities of the Italian Jewish leadership from the 1930s until the end of the war and the years afterward. Among other things these collections are particularly relevant from the point of view of the relationship between the Union and the Fascist government. Furthermore, it provides a rich corpus of documents regarding the measures of assistance towards Jewish refugees since the early 1930s.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Italy, material relevant to the Holocaust in Italy can be found in a number of institutions, including the German Bundesarchiv, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University, and Yad Vashem in Israel.",

                        "name": "Archivio storico della comunità ebraica di Mantova",
                        "history": "Quando, tra la metà del ‘300 e quella del ‘400, la presenza ebraica a Mantova era rappresentata solo da alcuni piccoli nuclei famigliari, la loro guida era nelle mani di pochi individui benpensanti che si occupavano della rappresentanza della Comunità verso il mondo esterno e della sua amministrazione all’interno. I documenti ed i libri mastri riguardanti questo piccolo gruppo di prestatori venivano conservati in casa di uno o dell’altro dei banchieri e non richiedevano un archivio od un posto particolare in cui conservarli in ordine.\r\nI primi segni di cambiamento di questa situazione si ebbero verso la fine del ‘400 quando, ampliandosi la Comunità, sorse la necessità di una organizzazione più democratica, con la partecipazione alla guida pubblica di più ampie cerchie di persone e con concentrazione del potere esecutivo nelle mani di persone in grado di dedicarsi a tempo pieno a questo compito.\r\nCon un simile cambiamento tutta la documentazione riguardante i rapporti sia interni, tra i singoli componenti della Comunità ebraica, sia esterni, tra la neonata “Università degli ebrei” e le autorità cittadine, acquistò evidentemente un valore assai maggiore e la sua corretta archiviazione diventò molto importante.\r\nVerso la metà del ‘500 nacque allora l’idea di predisporre una cassa in legno dotata di serratura destinata a contenere tutti i documenti riguardanti la vita comunitaria; una copia della chiave di questo cassone venne affidata a ciascuno dei tre massari in carica che probabilmente svolgevano il loro lavoro in qualche locale presso la Sinagoga Grande.\r\nCol passare del tempo l’archivio si ingrandì sensibilmente con ogni tipo di documenti: lettere, semplici ricevute di pagamenti o di prestiti, atti notarili, contratti di varia natura, resoconti processuali, registrazioni contabili, copie di bandi e di editti, scritture private, suppliche, inventari. Ovviamente molti erano i documenti scritti in ebraico e riguardanti rapporti comunitari interni; numerosi erano i documenti a stampa e le comunicazioni in italiano inviate dalle autorità cittadine alla “Università” per conoscenza (avvisi, editti, proclami); meno numerosi, ma ugualmente interessanti, erano i documenti a stampa in ebraico riguardanti le leggi suntuarie, le cosiddette pragmatiche.\r\nFinalmente, nel dicembre del 1778, il rabbino Azriel Yitzhaq Levi (o, col suo nome italiano, Bonaiuto Isacco), segretario della Comunità, correttore di bozze per la Tipografia d’Italia e poeta a tempo perso, ricevette dal Maggior Consiglio l’incarico di riordinare tutta la massa di documenti giacenti nell’archivio: “[…] onde ridurre alla più possibile utilità pubblica e privata l’Archivio di questa Comunità”.\r\nDal 1789 in poi il Levi, aiutato da un assistente, si dedicò con notevole capacità ed infinita pazienza al riordino e alla classificazione di tutto il materiale presente nell’archivio della Comunità ebraica di Mantova e scrisse un preciso e ricco “Repertorio Storico Enciclopedico dell’Archivio della Nazione Ebrea di Mantova sino a tutto l’anno 1790”; l’opera venne divisa in tre parti: Etica, Economia e Politica e fu manoscritta in dieci corposi volumi, tutti singoli tranne il quinto che è doppio.\r\nTutti i fogli cartacei vennero suddivisi per argomento e poi, all’atto della loro archiviazione, furono ‘infilzati’ al centro con un lungo ago che portava infilato nella cruna una sottile striscia di pelle terminante con un nodo. Questo sistema, per la verità drastico ed assai poco rispettoso dell’eventuale importanza del documento, spiega la presenza di un foro al centro di tutti i documenti raccolti nell’archivio.\r\nOggi l’Archivio storico della Comunità ebraica di Mantova ha la consistenza di alcune decine di migliaia di singoli documenti, parte manoscritti e parte a stampa; ciò è da considerarsi un evento quasi miracoloso specie se si pensa che questa enorme documentazione di rilevante valore storico è stata completamente e fortunatamente ignorata quando si trovava riposta in alcuni grossi armadi in un ufficio a piano terra della sede della Comunità durante l’occupazione tedesca tra il 1943 ed il 1944."

Since the War, the Ministry has focused on collecting and restoring documents lost in the wartime confusion and requesting former Allied Powers to return seized documents, as well as organizing existing papers.\r\n\r\nSince 1936 the Ministry has been publishing the Nihongaikobunsho (Documents on Japanese Foreign Policy), a chronological anthology of important documents collected from its archives , in order to contribute to greater understanding of foreign policy.\r\n\r\nIn the postwar era, especially after the Treaty of Peace with Japan signed in San Francisco in 1951, interest in the history of foreign policy has risen, which has in turn spurred rapid advances in research. The chronicles at Japan's Foreign Ministry have thus began to draw considerable attention and expectation from researchers and experts in the areas of diplomatic history, international politics, and other academic disciplines. The Ministry, however, had lacked the facilities to permit full access to its archives nor the staffing needed for full-scale archival management.\r\n\r\nIn response to requests from foreign policy researchers and experts to establish an archive comparable to those in Western nations, and because of the lack of space to keep prewar records in its archive, the Ministry established the Diplomatic Archives to preserve records from the end of the Tokugawa Period to the end of World War II in 1971.\r\n\r\nIn July 1988, the Annex was built to house an exhibition room, a library, a storage room and an administrative office. The Annex was donated by the late Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru Memorial Foundation."

Characteristics of the Kyrgyz archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe majority of the central and regional Kyrgyz archives were founded during the pre-war Soviet period. Consequently, most of them are based on the Soviet system of cataloging and most of the inventory files are written in Russian to this day. There are other archival institutions that were established or restructured after Kyrgyzstan’s independence. The former Archive of the Communist Party of Kyrgyzstan was renamed the Central State Archive of Social-Political Documentation. It holds a considerable collection of decrees related to the evacuation, the war effort and the history of the Jews. As a result of regime changes and administrative reforms, some archival institutions in Kyrgyzstan have been renamed, which may cause some initial confusion among researchers.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Kyrgyzstan**\r\n\r\nIn Kyrgyzstan, EHRI identified over fifteen archival institutions which hold or may hold Holocaust-relevant material. Four of the most important of them are concentrated in the republic’s former capital, Bishkek. The Central State Archive alone stores some 4,000 fonds, and the regional archives of Osh, Tokmok and Jalal-Abad hold a similarly impressive number of collections. Given the scale of mass evacuation and escape to Kyrgyzstan during the Second World War, many Holocaust-relevant collections are either known to be stored or can be expected to be found in the country’s archives. \r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Kyrgyzstan, EHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections that may prove relevant to Holocaust research on Kyrgyzstan. For instance, the State Archives of the Russian Federation and the Russian State Archives of Socio-Political History (former Central Communist Party Archive) in Moscow hold records and circulars sent to various Socialist Republics and have a large fonds on evacuation. In Israel, Yad Vashem holds documentation from archives in Kyrgyzstan from 1930 to 1960 and the Archives of the History of the Jewish people in Jerusalem also hold a handful of collections related to this period. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum stores selected records from the Central State Archive of Kyrgyzstan.\r\n",

The archives in the districts were headed by district executive committees, with whom the Archival Bureau maintained a close relationship. Their task was to identify and record the available archival materials in all institutions and create a local Unified State Archive Fund from these materials.\r\nFrom 1992 to 2005, regional, district and city archives were subordinate to the departments of archives and documentation under regional state administrations. In accordance with the Decree of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic of November 30, 2005 No. 607 “On Optimization of the Structure of State Bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic”, regional offices were liquidated and their functions were transferred to regional state archives.\r\n      Currently, there are 65 state archives in the Kyrgyz Republic: 3 central, 8 regional (in Osh oblast 2), 53 district and city state archives, 1 territorial archive (Suusamyr in Chui oblast). Central, regional (except for the Osh state archive of political documentation) state archives, as well as the Bishkek and Osh city state archives are directly subordinate to the State Archival Agency under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. The remaining city, district state archives, the Osh state archive of political documentation, the Jayil branch of the Chui regional state archive and the Suusymir territorial archive are under the jurisdiction of the regional state archives."

                "summary": "Relying on pre-existing research and expert support in Lithuania, EHRI has identified over 10 archival institutions in the country which have Holocaust-related collections. A list is provided in the extensive report. EHRI has identified and described over 100 Holocaust-relevant collections in the Lithuanian Central State Archives alone. A somewhat smaller number of fonds have been found and described in other Lithuanian archival institutions. The Vilna Gaon  Museum of Jewish History has collections with Holocaust-relevant material. Such material may also be found at the Judaica Research Centre of the Martynas Mažvydas National Library of Lithuania as well as at the National Museum of Lithuania, M. K. Čiurlionis National Art Museum, Kaunas Ninth Fort Museum, Museum of Occupations and Freedom fights, Sugihara House Museum, Samogitian Museum Alka, and at Šiaulių Aušros Museum.\r\n\r\nEHRI identified a number of archival institutions outside of Lithuania, which hold or may hold collections relevant for Holocaust research on Lithuania. Vast collections on the Holocaust period in Lithuania can be found at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, the Yad Vashem archive, the Jewish Heritage Museum in NYC collections, the Ghetto Fighters' House Archives, Beit Hatfutsot: Museum of the Jewish People in Tel Aviv, and the National Library of Israel. Furthermore, the Belarusian State Archive-Museum of Literature and Art [Belarussskij Gosudarstvennyj Archiv-Muzej Literatury i Iskusstva], the State Archive of the Russian Federation [Gosudarstvennij Archiv Rossijskoj Federacii, GARF] hold collections on Lithuania which may be relevant to Holocaust research, but EHRI has yet to explore their exact nature and importance.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Lithuania: Pre-existing research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nEHRI’s exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in Lithuania could rely on some important pre-existing research in the field, such as Christoph Dieckmann’s *Deutsche Besatzungspolitik in Litauen 1941-1944* (2011), which makes extensive use of archival material available in the country. EHRI also worked closely with the Vilna Gaon Museum of Jewish History in Vilnius, which became a consortium partner during EHRI’s second phase. Thanks to the support of this institution, EHRI has been able to identify important collections in over ten different institutions. There is one helpful archival guide on Holocaust-relevant sources in the Lithuanian Central State Archive, which is written in both Lithuanian and English:\r\n\r\n- [2011] Žirikova, Galina, *Lietuvos centrinio valstybės archyvo fondai: holokausto Lietuvoje tyrimo šaltinis* (*The Collections of the State Archive of Lithuania: a Source of Research on the Holocaust in Lithuania*), Vilnius: Valstybinis Vilniaus Gaono Žydų Muziejus, 2011.\r\n\r\nLitvakSIG (Lithuanian-Jewish Special Interest Group) is the primary internet resource for Lithuanian-Jewish (Litvak) genealogy research worldwide. All the data is available via the All Lithuania Database, a freely searchable database which has more than 2,500,000 records transcribed and translated from various archival institutions in Lithuania and abroad:\r\n- https://www.litvaksig.org/\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Lithuania’s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAn important number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created or are deposited in Lithuania and can still be found in the country’s archives today. The Chief Archivist’s Office allows free access to all fonds. Some restrictions may apply to files containing personal data, but even these can be used either by relatives of the persons named in such files, or for academic survey purposes after applying for a special permission to the archive’s director. Restricted source material cannot be published.\r\n\r\nOn a practical level, a working knowledge of Lithuanian and/or Russian is helpful for any kind of archival research in Lithuania, even though documents in other languages can also be found with the help of the local archival staff. Beyond that, archives in Lithuania offer a wide range of research tools, ranging from traditional card index catalogues to electronic catalogues. The digitalisation of file and fonds descriptions is in progress in most archives.\r\n\r\nConcerning Holocaust research, finding relevant documents can be difficult due to a certain lack of accuracy in available collection descriptions. EHRI’s expert on Lithuania estimates that only some 15% of all relevant descriptions actually contain the word \"Holocaust\", while the other 85%, which are potentially equally important, remain obscured. For instance, fonds on the Vilnius, Kaunas and Šiaulai ghettos are rather easy to find, while sources on the provincial regions of Lithuania are harder to come by. On the other hand, the Lithuanian Special Archives’ reading room offers an electronic register of participants in the Holocaust, such as Kaunas policemen in 1941/42. The names of participants and bystanders can be found, for instance, in survivor’s testimonies at the Lithuanian Central Archives. In the light of these findings, EHRI has made considerable headway in identifying and describing Holocaust-relevant collections in Lithuania, but the full potential of the country’s archival institutions remains to be determined. A survey of the collections held by small local museums in Lithuania, of private collections and of surviving photographs from the Holocaust period, is highly desirable.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Lithuania**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Lithuania**\r\n\r\nIn Lithuania, EHRI has identified over 10 archival institutions which hold Holocaust-related collections. Most of them are concentrated in the country’s capital, Vilnius. At the Lithuanian Central State Archives alone, EHRI has identified and described over 160 Holocaust-relevant collections, which contain, among others, sources produced by German District and Police Chiefs, various municipalities and prison administrations. At the other five Vilnius-based institutions, over 160 additional Holocaust-relevant collections have been identified and described so far. The Lithuanian Special Archives, for instance, contain the cases and trials of collaborators who persecuted Jews in Lithuania. The Vilna Gaon Museum of Jewish History, to which the Lithuanian Central State Archive has re-transferred a former collection in 1998 (parts of the LCVA fonds RG 1390 was catalogued under call number VŽM at the Museum) keeps records about Jews murdered in various Lithuanian cities, as well as relevant copied source material from archives in neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified a number of archival institutions outside of Lithuania, which hold or may hold collections relevant for Holocaust research on Lithuania. Vast collections on the Holocaust period in Lithuania can be found at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, Yad Vashem, the Jewish Heritage Museum in NYC collections, the Ghetto Fighters' House Archives, Beit Hatfutsot: Museum of the Jewish People in Tel Aviv, and the National Library of Israel.

It is assumed that the Germans took away the main part of the documents of the former pre-war archive of Klaipėda when they left, but some of the fonds were not taken away. Later, the old pre-war document fonds were transferred to the Central State Archive of the Lithuanian SSR.\r\nIn 1960, with the establishment of the Archives Board under the Council of Ministers of the Lithuanian SSR, the subordination of the state archive of the city of Klaipėda changed.\r\nOver the years, the archive was filled with new documents created in the activities of institutions, companies and organizations operating in the city and county (district) of Klaipėda. Since 1997, the archive has been called the Klaipėda County Archive, and since 2017, after connecting the archives of Tauragė and Telšiai counties to the archive, it has become the Klaipėda Regional State Archive."

One of the most prominent individuals in the Klaipėda region, Scheu was actively involved in the economic and cultural activities of East Prussia. Seeing how fast traditions and businesses were disappearing in the wake of the industrial revolution, he began collecting ethnographic and folkloric material of the Klaipėda region in two rooms of his manor house. Gradually, the manor museum built up a collection of ethnographic furniture, clothes, documents, prints and maps. In particular, it obtained many examples of old Lithuanian clothes and fabrics. This museum, the first of its kind in the region, was accessible to the intelligentsia and scientists.\r\n\r\nDuring the Second World War, the collections suffered from neglect, a situation which was compounded by the presence of Red Army units billeting in the manor. As the first manager of the museum collection post-1945 noted, ‘the majority of the exhibits have been knocked onto the floor and mixed with garbage…’. \r\n\r\nIn August 1948, the manor was given to the School of Horticulture and Beekeeping, which had originally been located in Kretinga. The museum was subsequently moved to a house in the center of Šilutė, Lietuvininkų str. 36. In 1949, it was reopened under a new name: Šilutė Local Lore Museum. M. Jonaitis, a teacher appointed as the director of the museum. At the time, the museum had 718 exhibits.\r\n\r\nBetween 1956 and 1961, the director of the museum was archaeologist J. Kvilonaitė. She focused on the archaeological monuments and renovation. The activities of the following director, D. Lukoševičiūtė-Narbutienė, greatly influenced the development of the museum's collections in 1961–1987; several expeditions were organized during which valuable household goods, fishing tools, agricultural implements and a number of prints were added to the museum’s collection. \r\n\r\nIn 1965, by the order of the Ministry of Culture, the Šilutė museum became a branch of the Klaipėda regional museum. The reorganisation did not benefit the museum. In 1972, the Klaipėda museum was subordinated to the Klaipėda Executive Committee and, eight years later, the Šilutė museum's main exhibitions were closed.\r\n\r\nWhen Lithuania declared its independence in 1990, the Šilutė county municipality re-established the museum. The Museum was renamed as the Šilutė museum. Changing the name of the institution also led to radical changes inside the museum; new exhibitions were prepared and the most valuable exhibits of Hugo Sheu's collection were once again put on display. \r\n\r\nThe museum went on to establish branches in Bitėnai, Švėkšna, Žemaičių Naumiestis and Macikai village.On 9 April 2015, the Šilutė museum changed its name into the Šilutė Hugo Sheu museum.\r\nOn 30 May 2015, the museum officially took up residence once again in the Šilokarčema manor.\r\n\r\nThe manor complex now includes a museum, a restoration and education center, where restoration workshops are established, and textile, metal and paper restorers are working, as well as an education classroom. The manor also houses the museum's internal library-archive.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the museum and its branches hold 60,150 exhibits."

After examining all the conditions, various opinions and suggestions, after assessment of possibilities to provide continuity to this project as well as quality of service and open access for public, the decision was made to establish the Vilnius Jewish Public Library as a structural unit of Vilnius County Adomas Mickevičius Public Library. Vilnius Jewish Library project was included to the 2011’s special commemoration of victims of the Holocaust memorial plan. The Library was granted premises located on Gedimino pr. 24.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of October, 2011 Mr. W. Brent signed endowment act regarding donation of his books collection to Vilnius County Adomas Mickevičius Public Library. On December 11 of the same year Library had its grand opening ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the Library is to ensure open and convenient access to creative work of Jewish authors and literature about actual and historical Jewish culture. While pursuing its main functions library also aspires to restore cultural heritage of Lithuanian Jewish people and revealing its contribution to Lithuania’s cultural, academic and social progress.\r\n\r\nIn implementing these objectives, the Library not only continues the first Jewish public library tradition in accumulation of books which reflects valuable Jewish history, art, religion and science, but also promotes cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue between the city communities using library for art exhibitions, presentations of books, conferences, discussions, lectures and other educational and cultural events.\r\n\r\nActive co-operation with members of the general public, civil and cultural activists as well as government agencies and non-governmental organizations is based on transparency and cooperation principles.

During this period, the Constitution was accepted, as well as additional legislation to regulate life in the newly independent nation and preserve national heritage. Thus, the Central National Archives were established in Kaunas, the capital of Lithuania at that time. In 1921, a peace treaty was signed between Soviet Russia and Lithuania facilitating the return to Kaunas of many documents that had been taken to Russia during the Czarist regime.\r\n\r\nDuring the second period under the Nazi rule, the archive continued its activities, albeit under certain restrictions. It was subject to Reichskommissariat Ostland, and was only open to visitors of German origin. In fact, the ongoing responsibility for the archives was under the control of the Office for Internal Affairs, which was located in Kaunas.\r\n\r\nThe third period, when the archives were under the Soviet regime, was actually divided in two. In 1940, following the invasion by the Soviet Union, the Archives administration was transferred to Vilnius. From an organisational point of view, the archives were now under the supervision of the NKVD. Confidential documents were transferred to the Soviet Union and afterwards were only partially returned. After the Second World War, the archives came once again under the supervision of the NKVD; in 1960, the responsibility for the archives was transferred to the National Council of Soviet Union Archives.\r\n\r\nThe current period began with the enactment of the Archives Law. The name of the main archives was changed to the Lithuanian Central State Archives, and the archives were transferred to the supervision of the Central Archives administration which is subject to the Lithuanian Council of Ministers."

A catalogue on another exhibition shown in the Musée national de la Résistance under the title “Between Shade and Darkness. Le sort des Juifs du Luxembourg de 1940 à 1945” was reprinted in 2016. There is also a recent, albeit non-academic, publication on the Jews of Luxembourg, published by Laurent Moyse: *Du rejet à l’intégration. Histoire des Juifs du Luxembourg des origines à nos jours* (2011).\r\n\r\nWorking with the Centre de Documentation et Recherche sur la Résistance (which has since closed) and the contemporary history section of the National Archives of Luxembourg, EHRI’s on-site surveys identified key archival institutions and two helpful archival guides :\r\n\r\n- [2003/1995] Spang, Paul, *Etat général des fonds conservés aux Archives nationales du Grand Duché de Luxembourg et aux archives de la Section historique de l’Institut grand-ducal* (Luxembourg, Publications de la Section historique de l'Institut grand-ducal, vol. 112-113: tome 1 1995, tome 2 2003)\r\n\r\n- [1978] *Grand-Duché de Luxembourg: Archives de l'Etat. Inventaire détaillé des affiches de la deuxième guerre mondiale* (Luxembourg: Ministère des affaires culturelles, 1978)\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Luxembourg archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe main archives are the National Archives located in Luxembourg City. A law on the archives was passed in 2018. In general, access is granted to documents older than 30 years. The files originating from the Prosecutor General’s Office are only accessible with a special permission from the Prosecutor General. Luxembourg also has private archives. Holocaust-related collections held by the National Archives include material generated by Luxembourg’s administration (both at home and in exile), the German occupation authorities, financial agencies, Jewish bodies and post-war investigations. The National Archives have also acquired the collections of the Centre de Documentation et de Recherche sur la Résistance when it closed in 2016. The archives of the city of Luxembourg possess some files related to the synagogue and its destruction. The local archives of Grevenmacher, Mondorf, Esch/Alzette, Differdange, Dudelange, Ettelbruck, towns where Jewish communities existed before the German occupation of Luxembourg, may keep some files pertaining to these communities. The local archives of Wintger keep a card file of those Jews imprisoned in the small ghetto of Fünfbrunnen [Cinqfontaines] before their deportation.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Luxembourg**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Luxembourg**\r\n\r\nIn Luxembourg, EHRI has so far identified two significant archival institutions:\r\n\r\n- City Archives of Luxembourg [Archives de la Ville de Luxembourg]\r\n\r\n- National Archives of Luxemburg [Archives nationales de Luxembourg/Luxemburger Nationalarchiv]\r\n\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nIn the EHRI Portal, Luxembourg is also covered by a number of other archival institutions, mainly the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Archives Nationales de France et the Archives générales du Royaume et Archives de l'État dans les Provinces / Algemeen Rijksarchief en Rijksarchief in de Provinciën (Belgium).",

The role of the National Archives is to collect and store records with archival value; provide accessibility of these records; supervise the observance of records management in the institutions and in the accredited private archives; accredit private archives; and perform the other functions specified in Archives Law. Within the National Archives, the role of the State Historical Archives is to administer the National Documentary Heritage of the Latvian archival fonds of 1220–1945, which includes documents of state and local authorities; courts; estates; religious organizations; political and public organizations; documents of enterprises and other legal persons; and documents of private persons. The State Archives, on the other hand, are tasked with the collection and preservation of: documents of central governmental institutions (parliament, cabinets of ministers, and other institutions) of the Republic of Latvia; documents of the Rīga and Jūrmala municipal institutions; personal fonds of Latvia and of foreign countries; and archives of Latvian exile organizations. The State Archives also hold documents concerning Latvian Social democracy; documents of the Communist Party of Latvia; and documents from the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic’s Committee of State Security (KGB) about repressed persons. The State Archives of Latvia ensure the preservation and use of documents related to Latvian history since 1940. In addition to these official archives, there are also a number of private archival institutions in Latvia.",
                "summary": "EHRI has identified seven archival institutions in Latvia, all of them concentrated in Riga. A full list can be found in the extensive report. While all of them store Holocaust-related collections, a local team of experts was able to provide EHRI with a tailor-made collection descriptions for the important Holocaust-related holdings of the State Historical Archives of Latvia, the State Archives of Latvia and the Latvia State Archive of Audiovisual Documents.\r\n\r\nOutside of Latvia, sources relevant to Holocaust research on Latvia can be found, among other institutions, at the Bundesarchiv, Yad Vashem, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Latvia: Pre-existing research, archival guides and expert support**\r\n\r\nEHRI’s exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in Latvia could rely on some important pre-existing research in the field, such as Katrin Reichelt’s *Lettland unter deutscher Besatzung 41-1944. Der lettische Anteil am Holocaust* (2011), and Andrej Angrick’s and Peter Klein’s *The Final Solution in Riga: Exploitation and Annihilation, 1941-1944* (2009).\r\n\r\nWorking extensively with the National Archives of Latvia, EHRI was able to identify important collections in three Riga-based archives: the National Archives of Latvia, State Historical Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacionālā arhīva Latvijas Valsts vēstures arhīvs, LNA LVVA]; the National Archives of Latvia, State Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacionālā arhīva Latvijas Valst arhīvs, LNA LVA]; and the Latvia State Archive of Audiovisual Documents [Latvijas Valsts kinofotofonodokumentu arhivs]. \r\n\r\nAn overview of Latvian State Archives, which is written in both Latvian and English and available in print and online, suggests that there are more Holocaust-relevant archives to discover, especially among the eleven Regional State Archives:\r\n\r\n- [2004] Bušmane, Inta/Maija Āboltin̦a (ed.), *Valsts arhīvi Latvijā / Latvia state archives* (Riga: Latvijas Valsts arhīvu g̕enerāldirekcija : \"Mantojums\", [2004]), (http://www.arhivi.lv/sitedata/VAS/Arhivu%20vesture/Latvijas%20valsts%20arhivi.pdf)\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Latvia’s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAn important number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created or have been deposited in Latvia and can still be found in the country’s archives today. Access to them appears to be unrestricted, but some limits to the use of personal data are to be expected. The most frequent languages of the sources are German, Russian and Latvian. On a practical level, a working knowledge of Latvian and/or Russian is probably necessary for any kind of archival research in Latvia, even though documents in other languages can also be found with the help of the local archival staff.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Latvia**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Latvia**\r\n\r\nHolocaust-relevant sources in Latvia are concentrated in the country’s capital, Riga and in two archives in particular:\r\n\r\n- the National Archives of Latvia, State Historical Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacionālā arhīva Latvijas Valsts vēstures arhīvs, LNA LVVA], which keeps mostly documents from the period until 1944, and\r\n\r\n- the National Archives of Latvia, State Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacionālā arhīva Latvijas Valst arhīvs, LNA LVA], which keep documents from the period since 1945.\r\n\r\nAt the State Historical Archives alone, EHRI has identified and described over 50 Holocaust-related fonds, some of which contain thousands of files pertaining to all of Latvia or to certain regions, districts and cities. The fonds identified and described by EHRI include collections of sources produced by German occupation and administrative authorities, such as the Reichskommissar Ostland or the SS and Police Leader in Latvia, but also ample sources left by local Latvian institutions, e.g. very extensive District Police records. The sources for the survey consisted of the, mostly printed, finding aids available at the archives. For example, the fonds of the Commissar General in Riga contains seven finding aids that describe the German records in Latvian. These handwritten and typed finding aids are available at the reading room.\r\n\r\nAt the State Archives of Latvia, EHRI has identified three important Holocaust-related fonds of Soviet origin, which contain material on war crimes investigations in Latvia. The identification and investigation work on these two fonds was carried out by local experts. Most of the work consisted of document analysis and research on previously undescribed archive fonds no. 1986. The work included reviewing the fonds card index (93,608 cards) and 26 record registration journals. As this fonds had no description, it was necessary to compare the data in the card index with the data in the registration journals to find certain criminal cases (persons convicted or judged). These criminal cases are usually several volumes long. To find all information about the Holocaust victims, one would have to examine all 52,653 records. The survey team looked through the criminal cases which consisted of a large number volumes, such as the files of Victor Arājs (1910-1988) and Boļeslavs Maikovskis (1904-1996). The former was the Chief of the Arājs Command who committed mass executions of Jews for the German Security Police. Arājs was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1979 by a Hamburg court. Boleslavs Maikovskis was a Latvian who served as chief of police for the second precinct of Rēzekne during the German occupation of Latvia in the Second World War. Maikovskis was tried under the German court system in 1988, but by 1994 was deemed too frail to continue the trial. Together, these cases are enclosed in dozens of volumes. Approximately 90% of the KGB documents are in Russian.\r\n\r\nEHRI has also added collection descriptions of sources held by the Latvia State Archive of Audiovisual Documents [Latvijas Valsts kinofotofonodokumentu arhivs].\r\n\r\nIn addition to the three archives named above, EHRI has identified four more institutions in Riga which hold Holocaust-relevant material on Latvia:\r\n\r\n- the Museum “Jews in Latvia” [Muzejs “Ebreji Latvijā],\r\n\r\n- the Museum of the Occupation of Latvia 1940-1991 [Latvijas Okupācijas muzejs],\r\n\r\n- the Riga Ghetto and Latvian Holocaust Museum [Rīga geto un Latvijas Holokausta muzejs].\r\n\r\n- National Archives of Latvia - State Archives of Personnel Documents [Latvijas Nacionālais arhīvs - Personāla dokumentu valsts arhīvs]\r\n\r\nThe repository descriptions for these institutions provide researchers with general information on the materials that can be found here.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Latvia, sources relevant to Holocaust research on Latvia can be found at Yad Vashem, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies and other locations.\r\n",

Finding aid] (Tiraspol', 2010)\r\n\r\nRelying on these finding aids, EHRI identified relevant archival fonds, compared archival holdings in Moldova with the archival holdings copied from Moldovan archives by the USHMM and Yad Vashem, and introduced both to the EHRI database.\r\n\r\nEHRI established contact with the director of the National Archives of the Republic of Moldova (NARM) in order to facilitate access to the Holocaust-relevant archival sources for EHRI Moldova country experts. Taking into account that a number of highly relevant documents are still stored at the Special State Repository of the Intelligence and Security Service (SIS), which regularly does not provide access to researchers, the full extent and importance of Holocaust-related documents held in Moldova is yet to be determined.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Moldova's archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nMoldova exhibits a highly centralized archival system and its administration, the State Archival Agency (Agenția Națională a Arhivelor) is in charge of the State archival system. The state archives are made up of two major archives in Chisinau and multiple regional and departmental archives. For a guide to the Moldova's archival system and its history see Mihai Taşcă et al., Ghidul arhivelor din Republica Moldova [Guidebook for the Archives in the Republic of Moldova] (Chișinău: Pontos, 2011). Prewar archival documents of Bessarabia and MASSR are stored in the NARM due to centralization effort during the 1950s. \r\n\r\nThe main challenge regarding research in Moldova's archives is the accessibility of data. Some documents of the archival fonds remain partially closed to the public. In NARM and the Archives of Socio-Political Organizations of the Republic of Moldova [AOSP, Arhiva Organizaţiilor Social-Politice ale Republicii Moldova] accessibility to inventories remains a challenge as the latter are only partially available in the reading rooms and must be requested separately. Access to thematic catalogues and the provision of advice and guidance to researchers are also often problematic. The archives in Moldova have only very recently started to digitise their collections.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Moldova**\r\n\r\n**C.I In Moldova**\r\n\r\nIn Moldova, EHRI has identified several archival institutions which hold or may hold Holocaust-relevant documents on Bessarabia and Transnistria. For these institutions, EHRI has made over 150 Holocaust-relevant archival descriptions available. In the NARM, EHRI identified documents on the prewar Jewish life and education, as well as wartime documents issued by the Romanian authorities related to administration of Bessarabia and Transnistria Governorate: directorates, town administrations [primaria], county administrations [prefectura] and district administrations [pretura], files of the gendarmery, corps of the Romanian army, police, tribunals, financial administration, chambers of commerce and industry, religious administration et altc. In the AOSP and Central State Archive of the (unrecognised) Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic [Tsentral'nyy Gosudarstvennyy Arkhiv Pridnestrovskoy Moldavskoy Respubliki], EHRI identified documents of the post-war Soviet authorities that mainly relate to the effort to assess the damage and human losses caused by the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n**C.II In other countries**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections outside of Moldova that are relevant to Holocaust research. Primarily, these are Holocaust-relevant collections at the USHMM, which has numerous microfilmed records from the NARM, as well as People’s Commissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVD) war crimes investigation and trial documents, and dozens of oral history interviews from Moldova. EHRI identified and introduced files to the database that are stored at the NARM, but are not mentioned in the NARM finding aid. Copies of these files, however, are available in the USHMM, including the files of the Republican Board of the Moldovan SSR to promote the activity of the emergency state commission for the investigation of crimes committed by German-Fascist invaders (1943-1947). In Israel, at Yad Vashem, EHRI identified war crimes investigation and trial records copied from the Special State Repository of the Intelligence and Security Service.\r\n\r\n",

Notably, the national “Heritage of War Programme” (2005-2009) intended to preserve the memories about the war for future generations, provided EHRI with a solid starting point. Existing descriptions have also been taken from the database behind the website on Dutch WWII archival sources. In a few cases, more detailed descriptions have been taken directly from the institutions themselves, such as NIOD and the Amsterdam City Archives.\r\n\r\nEHRI was able to identify a number of helpful archival guides, both online and offline:\r\n\r\n- http://www.archievenwo2.nl\r\n\r\nThis site unifies information on archives and collections on National-Socialism and the Second World War concerning the Netherlands, the Dutch East Indies, Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles. It is available in Dutch only and does not display archival documents, but serves as a search tool to locate archives and collections.\r\n\r\n- http://www.kamparchieven.nl\r\n\r\nThis site offers a survey of archives and collections of the German camps that existed in the Netherlands during the Second World War (Amersfoort, Vught, Westerbork, Schoorl en Ommen). It is available in Dutch and English and is an initiative of the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies in collaboration with several other institutions (War Aftercare Department of the Netherlands Red Cross; Eemland Archive; Brabant Historical Information Centre (BHIC); Drenthe Archive; Midden-Drenthe Municipality Archive; Memorial Centre Camp Westerbork; National Monument Camp Amersfoort; National Monument Camp Vught; Regional Archive Alkmaar).\r\n\r\n- http://www.oorlogsgetroffenen.nl\r\n\r\nThis site unifies information on archives and collections from organizations involved in tracing, repatriating and sheltering victims of the Second World War in the aftermath of the conflict. It is available in Dutch only.\r\n\r\n- http://www.beeldbankwo2.nl\r\n\r\nThis database brings together all the images of the Second World War that can be found in the collections of Dutch war and resistance museums, commemoration centres and NIOD. Anyone can view and order the images.\r\nThe following traditional archival guides identified by EHRI also deserve to be mentioned:\r\n\r\n- [1998] J.M.L. van Bockxmeer, P.C.A. Lamboo en H.A.J. van Schie, *Onderzoeksgids Joodse oorlogsgetroffenen; overzicht van archieven met gegevens over roof, recuperatie, rechtsherstel en schadevergoeding van vermogens van Joden in Nederland in de periode 1940-1987* (Den Haag: Algemeen Rijksarchief, 1998)\r\n\r\n- [1994] Erik Somers and Mark Pier, *Archievengids van de Tweede Wereldoorlogs. Nederland en Nederlands-Indië* (Zuthpen: Walburg Instituut, Rijksinstituut voor Oorlogsdocumentatie, 1994)\r\n\r\n- [1989] Atie van der Horst, Elly Koen, *Guide to the International Archives and Collections at the IISH* (Amsterdam: International Institute of Social History, 1989)\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Dutch archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAccording to the Dutch Public Records Act (1995), public archives are divided into State (Rijks), Communal (Gemeentelijke) and Regional (waterschaps) archival repositories. The National Archives [Nationaal Archief] are the central repository for archives transferred from national government bodies. The National Archivist is the head of the State Archive Service [Rijksarchiefdienst] and the Dutch National Archives. Besides the National Archives in The Hague, there are ten State Archives in the other provincial capitals, which were transformed (often after a merger with the city archives) into Regional Historical Centres [Regionaal Historische Centra] between 1998 and 2005. In addition to the state archives, there are collections in private archives and museums. A working knowledge of Dutch is necessary for any kind of archival research in the Netherlands, even though documents in other languages (German, English and French) can also be found with the help of the local archival staff.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on the Netherlands**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In the Netherlands**\r\n\r\nA considerable number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created in the Netherlands and can still be found in the country’s archives today. NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies holds important Holocaust collections. A joint effort of the National Archives and NIOD led to the creation of a website on Dutch WWII archival sources. A thematic query on “persecution of the Jews” leads to 773 archival collections in 142 archival institutions. These cover a broad variety of institutions, national as well as local and specialised institutions. There are also a number of private archives and documentation centres, such as the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam, which hold important Holocaust-related collections.\r\nEHRI identified over 160 repositories in the Netherlands and is able to provide thousands of descriptions of Holocaust-relevant archival units, most of which can be found at NIOD and at the Amsterdam City Archives.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections outside of the Netherlands that are relevant to Holocaust research on the Netherlands. In Germany and Israel, the Arolsen Archives and Yad Vashem hold significant documentation and a huge quantity of sources pertaining to Jewish individuals and/or groups during the Holocaust period.",

At that time, the (then) South Holland municipalities of Woerden, Bodegraven, Reeuwijk and Driebruggen and the Groot-Waterschap of Woerden established the Streekarchivariaat Rijnstreek. It was located in the town hall of Woerden. Municipal redivisions and the merger of water boards into Hoogheemraadschap De Stichtse Rijnlanden increased the working area. In 1994, the municipality of Montfoort joined the joint arrangement. Finally, in 2008, the municipalities of IJsselstein, Lopik and Oudewater joined in, municipalities that until then had had their own archives. On this occasion the regional archive service was renamed the Regional Historic Centre Rijnstreek and Lopikerwaard."

A modern exhibition with the theme ‘Kiezen Toen & Nu’ (‘Choices: Then & Now’) showed that the German occupation was not as straightforward and clear-cut as is generally presumed. In 2013, the Fries Verzetsmuseum moved along with the Fries Museum to the new building on Wilhelminaplein in Leeuwarden."

A full list is available in an extensive report.",
                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Poland: Pre-existing research and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Poland, EHRI could rely on a vast amount of pre-existing research on the Holocaust. Research on this topic has been conducted for decades now by historians not only in Poland, Germany, the United States and Israel, but also in a number of other countries. Consequently, EHRI is unable to give a full and up-to-date account of the available literature here. However, it is important to highlight the 16 volume series *Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der europäischen Juden durch das nationalsozialistische Deutschland 1933-1945*, which is being published by EHRI-partner Institute for Contemporary History Munich-Berlin [Institut für Zeitgeschichte München-Berlin, IfZ] and Bundesarchiv, especially volumes 4 and 9, and 10. All volumes contain introductions based on international research literature and (as of 2024) are being translated into English (pmj-documents.org). Furthermore, the *Jewish History Quarterly* [*Kwartalnik Historii Żydów*], which is published by the Warsaw-based Emanuel Ringelblum Jewish Historical Institute [Żydowski Institut Historyczny im. Emanuela Ringelbluma, ŻIH] and the periodical “Zagłada Żydów” are probably the most reliable periodicals on current Holocaust research on Poland.\r\n\r\nEHRI has also relied on the following archival guides:\r\n- [1998-2011] Jóźwik, Marek (eds.), *Relacje z czasów zagłady - inwentarz / Holocaust survivors testimonies catalogue*, Archiwum ŻIH - INB, zespół 301 (Warsaw, Instytut Naukowo-Badawczy, 1998-2011)\r\n- [2009] Bednarek, Jerzy & Rafał Leśkiewicz (eds.), *Informator o zasobie archiwalnym Instytutu Pamięci Narodowej* (stan na dzień 31 grudnia 2008 roku) (Warszawa: IPN, 2009)\r\n- [2009] Shapiro, Robert Moses and Epsztein, Tadeusz, *The Warsaw Ghetto Oyneg Shabes-Ringelblum Archive, catalog and guide*, Bloomington, IN (Indiana Univ.

Informator o materiałach źródłowych przechowywanych w archiwach PRL* (Warszawa, 1972)\r\n\r\nWith EHRI’s help, the most comprehensive guide has been updated and translated from Polish into English: Alina Skibińska, *Guide to the Sources on the Holocaust in Occupied Poland* (Translated and expanded edition of the original *Polish Źródła do badań nad zagładą Żydów na okupowanych ziemiach polskich* by Alina Skibińska, Warsaw, 2007), European Holocaust Research Infrastructure, 2014, https://training.ehri-project.eu/sites/training/files/portal_assets/skibinska_guide.pdf.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Poland’s archival situation and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nUntil around 1990, the Polish state archival system imitated Soviet structures, which involved strong tendencies towards centralisation and almost complete inaccessibility. The network of Polish state archives opened up only after the crumbling of the Soviet bloc and the fall of communism in Poland. Since then, the network of state archives has functioned under the Head Office of State Archives [Naczelna Dyrekcja Archiwów Państwowych, NDAP].\r\n\r\nIn addition to the NDAP network, there is the Institute of National Remembrance [Instytut Pamięci Narodowej, IPN] which was created in 1998 as a successor organisation to the Main Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes [Główna Komisja Badania Zbrodni Hitlerowskich]. As the name suggests, it stores mainly documents on Nazi Crimes transferred from state archives, but also increasingly state security service files from the post-war period.\r\n\r\nOutside of the state archival and IPN networks, there is a wide range of archival institutions which hold Holocaust-relevant collections. There is, of course, the Jewish Historical Institute [Żydowski Instytut Historyczny, ŻIH] in Warsaw, which deserves a special mention as a key institution for Holocaust research on Poland and beyond, but also the network of church archives throughout Poland, and various archives of central administrative institutions, such as the Central Statistical Office [Główny Urząd Statystyczny, GUS]. The Archive of the Polish Red Cross also deserves to be mentioned. Finally, there are a number of state museums which were created in former German concentration camps (most importantly in Auschwitz, but also Majdanek) which hold, to a certain extent, archival material relevant for Holocaust research on Poland. A number of private institutions are also likely to hold Holocaust-relevant sources; important private research centres are “Karta” in Warsaw and Brama Grodzka in Lublin.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Poland**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Poland**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified over 100 archival institutions in Poland which hold or may hold Holocaust-relevant collections. At this point, it appears that a number of state archives which exist in all the major cities and in some regional centres throughout the country hold the most extensive Holocaust-relevant collections. The Central Archives of Modern Records [Archiwum Akt Nowych, AAN] in Warsaw and the local state archives hold essential collections concerning the German occupation in Poland, sources produced by the Polish resistance movement, but also documents created in the numerous ghettos in occupied Poland. In this regard, the State Archive in Łódź deserves a special mention, as it holds the archive of the Litzmannstadt ghetto. The Warsaw-based Jewish Historical Institute (ŻIH) stores the underground archive of the Warsaw ghetto (Ringelblum Archive), a key collection to Holocaust research in Poland. The ŻIH’s collections of testimonies and memoirs which were written and recorded after the war cover all of occupied Poland, including its former eastern territories (today Belarus, Lithuania and Ukraine), and even Germany, as former inmates of German camps and forced labourers in Germany left their testimonies at the Institute as well. In terms of the sheer quantity of sources, the collections described by EHRI in the state archives of Bydgoszcz, Lublin, Łódź, Poznań and Warsaw appear to be the most significant ones so far. Obviously, the somewhat smaller archival holdings identified elsewhere in Poland archives are not necessarily less important.\r\n\r\nThe collection descriptions in EHRI have been added from the archives’ databases (in Polish), combined with the English information in the Skibińska guide.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nAlina Skibińska’s *Guide to the Sources on the Holocaust in Occupied Poland* (Translated and expanded edition of the original Polish *Źródła do badań nad zagładą Żydów na okupowanych ziemiach polskich* by Alina Skibińska, Warsaw, 2007), European Holocaust Research Infrastructure, 2014, https://training.ehri-project.eu/sites/training/files/portal_assets/skibinska_guide.pdf includes information on sources on Poland held at repositories in Germany, Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States.",

                        "history": "Office of Information and Tracing of the Polish Red Cross operates continuously since 1919. In 1919-1921 it was involved in collecting information about the victims of national uprisings and the transfer of information to prisoners of war. Office also took part in the reception of Polish political prisoners coming from the Soviet Union at the Polish border and was looking for their families and documents.\r\nWith the outbreak of World War II the Office began to prepare lists of the dead, the wounded, sick and missing. A database of names was created. On 23 September 1939 the seat of the Office of Information and Tracing was bombed. Workers were trying to protect the remainder of the documents. The Red Cross branches in various Polish cities organized Sections of Information and Research. Information was collected from parish and municipal offices and from private individuals. In the temporary camps for prisoners of war, Polish Red Cross registered the prisoners and participated in the transmission of letters from their families.\r\nSince December 1939 Polish Red Cross Delegations started their activities in many countries. They conducted searching of Polish citizens, both military and civilian, and prepared the database of Polish of prisoners of war, staying in Oflag and Stalag camps. Thousands of requests for search were sent and much information about persons deported and interned was obtained. Thus a new Office database was created.\r\nAfter the discovery in 1943 of the mass graves of Polish officers murdered in Katyn, the Technical Committee of the Polish Red Cross was appointed, which  led the exhumation in the period from April until June 1943. Thanks to the work of the Commission the list was prepared by the Delegation of the Polish Red Cross in Geneva, comprising 2805 names. For a long time it was the only basis for the issuance of certificates to the families of victims.\r\nOn August 2, 1944, during the Warsaw Uprising, the Office of Information and Tracing has been set on fire by SS. Then the painstakingly created database comprising over 1 500 000  cards was burnt down, together with thousands of valuable documents. Again the Office began to write down losses and to prepare site plans of temporary graves for the future exhumation. Hospitals of the Polish Red Cross prepared the lists of the names of the sick, the wounded and the dead, and then, if possible, the family were notified. On 21 October, 1944, employees of the Office together with the whole of the material collected had to leave Warsaw. Office facilities opened in many places. Families were informed about the fate of people evacuated from Warsaw.\r\nAfter the war, the most urgent thing was to find the children sent to Germany by the \"Lebensborn\". The number of Polish children submitted to Germanization was estimated on 200 000. Delegations of the Polish Red Cross in Germany were supposed to find the children and to reclaim them. Office of Information and Tracing in Warsaw transferred the lists of missing children to the Delegations in Germany. Polish Red Cross was also receiving transports of children from Germany and Austria. In the years 1946-1948 tens of thousands of children returned to Poland.\r\nAnother important task was the exhumation of war graves, conducted with the participation of the Red Cross throughout the country. In some places the municipal and county offices led the exhumations, and documents were forwarded to the Office of Information and Tracing, permitting to identify thousands of individuals. Collected and recorded were also accounts of people who witnessed mass executions. Information and Tracing Office also led the search for the graves of foreigners, dead and fallen on Polish territory.\r\nAfter the war the Information and Tracking Office took over the files of the Polish Red Cross  Delegations operating abroad, local branches of the Polish Red Cross, the materials received from the Allied military authorities, the International Committee of the Red Cross, many documents were transferred from the Main Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes in Poland.\r\nThe Office of Infromation and Tracing participated in the action of helping former prisoners of Nazi concentration camps, subjected to pseudo-medical experiments. In 1960. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany has decided to grant a one-time financial assistance to surviving victims of pseudo-medical experiments performed in Nazi concentration camps. Due to the lack of diplomatic relations between Poland and the FRG, assistance was obtained through the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva. Polish Red Cross has been authorized to represent the interests of the Polish victims at the ICRC. The Office gathered all the documentation on these matters and transferred it to ICRC.\r\nIn the last few years, the Office has issued about 30 000 certificates proving stay in concentration camps, forced labor and prisons on the basis of the documents submitted by former prisoners or obtained from domestic and foreign archives as a result of the efforts taken by the Office. It was related to the payment of cash benefits by the Government of FRG for the victims of the Third Reich.\r\n"

In 1976, according to the reform of state administration, the archive became the Jelenia Góra Voivodship State Archive. In 1991 it was reorganized again into the branch of Wrocław State Archive."

                        "name": "Zakład Narodowy im. Ossolińskich",
                        "history": "Józef Maksymilian Ossoliński (1748-1826), a writer, collector and scholar, was a member of many learned institutions, such as the Warsaw Scientific Society, the Wilno Academy, the Cracow Academy, the Royal Societies in Prague and Göttingen, the Imperial-Royal Society in Vienna, and a doctor honoris causa of the Jagiellonian University. With the foundation act of June 1817 he handed over to the Polish nation valuable collections of books, manuscripts and museum pieces, and at the same time he defined the character of the Institute’s activity, which was to save the cultural heritage of the nation devoid of its statehood by drawing on the resources of Polish literature and museum collections.\r\n\r\nThe source of the Institute’s upkeep were revenues from the Founder’s landed estates. From 1827 to 1945 the Institute was housed in Lwów and its existence was vital to the activities of the Faculty of the Humanities of the Jan Kazimierz University.\r\n\r\nInitially, the Institute was to consist of two branches: the Library and the Publishing House. However, as a result of an agreement between Józef Maksymilian Ossoliński and Prince Henryk Lubomirski, who decided to hand over his own museum collections to the Institute, a third section was created in 1824 by the name of the Lubomirski Museum. The post of the literary curator – the Institute’s highest authority – was to become a hereditary function of the Lubomirski family. From the very beginning, the Institute served Polish science and education and cultivated patriotic traditions. In the years of national bondage the Ossolineum published Monumenta Poloniae Historica, a critical edition of Samuel Bogumił Linde’s Słownik Języka Polskiego (Dictionary of the Polish Language) and numerous other works from the fields of history, history of Poland, literary sciences and history of culture, important for the Polish science.\r\n\r\nIn the period of the Second Republic (1918-1939) the Institute developed dynamically. It published scientific works as well as belles lettres and became one the leading publishing houses of the independent Poland. During that time the Ossolineum holdings were enriched by many new collections, including those of the Lubomirski family of Kruszyna, the Potocki family of Raj, and the Jabłonowski family of Bursztyn, as well as by numerous bequests made by Polish scholars.\r\n\r\nDuring the Second World War the printed collections of the Library were doubled as many private collections were stored there for safety, including those of the Baworowski and Dzieduszycki families as well as numerous donations and deposits made by the civilian population. During World War II, the already numerous and valuable collections of the Ossolineum first fell into Soviet hands and then passed to the Germans. In July 1941 the government of the GG appointed Mieczysław Gębarowicz custodian of the Ossoliński Foundation. When in early 1944 the Germans planned to remove some of the objects to the Third Reich, it was he who “took advantage of the situation for his own evacuation plans for the Polish collections. The most precious of the Ossolineum collections were packed into two transports (around 2,300 manuscripts, around 2,200 diplomas, around 1,800 old prints and around 2,300 drawings (...). In March and April 1944 they were transported to Kraków, where they were to see out the war in the safety of the Jagiellonian Library cellars, but in July 1944 the German authorities decided to move them to the Reich. The transport was abandoned in the village of Adelin (now Zagrodno, Poland) in Lower Silesia, and it was here, after the end of hostilities, that the Poles found them.\r\n\r\nAfter the war Lwów was incorporated into the Soviet Union. Only a part of the Ossolineum collections was transferred from Lwów to Wrocław. These collections were made accessible to the public as early as September 1947. The source of the Institute’s upkeep in the new historical circumstances, after the nationalisation in 1945 of all landed estates, was the state treasury. In 1953, the Ossolineum Library and Publishing House were transformed into branches of the newly created Polish Academy of Sciences. The Ossolineum collections constituted a scholarly workshop for the Wroclaw humanities as they reemerged after the war. The bulk of the collections remained, however, in Lwów, including autographs, diplomas, drawings and prints, photographs, numismatic objects, medals, seals, periodicals and a part of the manuscript collections. At present a report is being prepared on the losses sustained by the Ossolineum Library as a result of the change of national borders after the Second World War. These losses are estimated at about 60 percent. Efforts are being made to recover the Ossolineum collections.\r\n\r\nIn 1990 the post of Ossolineum’s director was assumed by Dr Adolf Juzwenko , who undertook efforts to reactivate the Foundation – the original status of the Institute. On January 5, 1995 the Parliament of the Republic of Poland passed the act on „the foundation – the Ossoliński National Institute (Official Gazette 1995, no. 23, item 121). On the strength of this act patronage over the Institute was assumed by the President of the Republic of Poland and the direct supervision is performed by the Board of Curators.\r\n\r\nFor almost two hundred years of the Institute’s activity, the collections handed over by the Founder to the Polish nation have constantly been enlarged, mainly through donations, exchange and purchase. Altogether, the Ossolineum collections of the nineteenth and twentieth century books and periodicals, old books, manuscripts, prints, maps and numismatic objects comprise at present ca 1,800,000 items. It is a constantly growing stock. Each year ca 10,000 books and 5,000 units of periodicals are added to it. Special collections grow by several hundred items yearly."

                        "history": "The history of the Warsaw Archives is closely tied to the history of the city of Warsaw and its municipal administration. The latest research shows that Warsaw was probably founded near the estate of the Prince of Masovia in Jazdów between the 13th and 14th century. \r\n\r\nThe turning-point in the history of the city of Warsaw and the city Archives was included in the Polish Constitution of May 3rd, 1791. It was the law of crown towns and cities in the Polish Kingdom. The General City Archives of Warsaw were established in April 1792. The new institution was to preserve all municipal administration records. \r\n\r\nIn 1810 the Prince of Warsaw issued an edict which moved the oldest municipal records (c.a. 1800 vol.) to the Archives of Historical Records in Warsaw. In 1817 the remaining records were moved to the new City Hall building in the old Jabłonowski Palace located at today's Theater Square, close to the Old Town. The old, medieval building of the City Hall was demolished.\r\nIn October 1863, during the January Uprising, Polish underground militants burned the City Hall in order to destroy the records which could be dangerous when in hands of the Russian  administration. The building of the City Hall and a large part of the Archives was burned. Fortunately the oldest records were partly rescued by archivists who threw them out through the windows on the backyard. When the City Hall was reconstructed in 1864-1869, the Archives were moved to the Namiestnikowski Palace (now the Presidential Palace). In the reconstructed City Hall a special archival repository with 330 square meters of space was assigned. In 1893 the Archive preserved ca. 40 thousand volumes of records.\t\r\n\r\nJust before Poland regained independence new regulations for Warsaw municipal administration have been approved. In 1917 on the basis of these regulations the Main Archive of the Warsaw Municipal Administration was established. In 1938 the archive was transferred to the building of former Arsenal.\r\nThe most damage to the holdings was done during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. The records survived heavy fights, however just after the fighting was over the Nazi troops methodically burnt down all archival records kept in the Arsenal.\r\nIn the April 1945, after Warsaw was liberated, the Warsaw City Archives were brought back to life by the President of Warsaw. In the beginning the Archives occupied a few rooms at 8 Marszałkowska street. In 1955 the Archives received three reconstructed townhouses (7 and 9 Krzywe Koło street and 12 Nowomiejska street). For almost half a century now these buildings have been the main seat of the Archives. In June 1951 the Warsaw City Archives were incorporated in the structure of the state archives and received a new name - Voivodship State Archive. The scope of activity of the Archive changed, too, as it was now to cover the whole Warsaw Voivodship (Masovia region). In 1976, according to the reform of state administration, the archive was renamed the State Archive of the Capital City of Warsaw. Since 2013 the archive is named the State Archive in Warsaw.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see http://warszawa.ap.gov.pl/english/history.html"

                        "history": "Calouste Sarkis Gulbenkian, born in Üsküdar, Turkey, of Armenian origin, fled persecution with his family in 1896, settling in London after a brief stay in Cairo. He later acquired British nationality and a palace in Paris. With the onset of World War II, Gulbenkian moved to Lisbon, where he passed away in 1955.\r\n\r\nA passionate art collector, Gulbenkian's eclectic collection of over 6,000 pieces spans antiquity to the early twentieth century, reflecting his diverse travels and personal taste. Notable works include pieces from ancient Egypt, Greece, Babylonia, Persia, and Europe. His collection also features works by renowned artists such as Rubens, Rembrandt, and Monet.\r\n\r\nConcerned about preserving his legacy and avoiding taxes, Gulbenkian explored housing options for his collection, including discussions with Kenneth Clark for a proposed 'Gulbenkian Institute' at the National Gallery in London. However, wartime complications and suspicions led him to consider the National Gallery of Art in Washington.\r\n\r\nUpon his death, negotiations with the French Government and the National Gallery in Washington ensued, culminating in the collection's exhibition at the Palace of the Marquises of Pombal in Portugal from 1965 to 1969. Finally, in 1972, the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum was established in Lisbon, fulfilling Gulbenkian's desire for a dedicated space to showcase his life's work."

                        "name": "Arquivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo",
                        "history": "The Torre do Tombo is one of Portugal's oldest institutions. Since it was installed in one of the towers of Lisbon castle, probably during the reign of King Dom Fernando, and certainly from 1378, date of the first known certificate, until 1755, it served as the Archives of the king, his vassals, the administration of the kingdom and the overseas possessions, as well as keeping the documents resulting from the relations with other kingdoms.\r\n\r\nBesides serving the royal administration, with functions similar to those of a modern-day intermediate archive, the most important service provided by the Tower was that of certificates, requested by individuals and institutions. With the king's authorisation, it provided consultation and even the loan of documents to some scholars, whose works were later printed.\r\nIn the 17th century, the Archive of the Archives started to be organised and the first record books appeared, and some indexes were made. In the 18th century, the growing number of certificates requested to the Torre do Tombo, especially those requested by the History Academy, increased the number of its officers. In this century, in the scope of the description of the documents, numerous indexes were produced, meeting the need to know the documents and to create the necessary research tools for their recovery: this work started and took place, in good part, in the building of the castle tower: This is how most of the indexes of the royal Chancelleries (1715-1749), the Laws and Ordinances (1731), the Bulls (1732), the Residents of the Royal Household (between 1713 and 1742), the inventory of the Bulae, Breves and Pontifical Transcripts (1751-1753) were drawn up.\r\n\r\nOn November 1st 1755, the tower collapsed during the earthquake. The documentation was collected from the rubble, and temporarily kept in a wooden hut, built in the Praça de Armas, after authorization from the Marquis of Pombal, dated November 6. On 26 and 27 August 1757, it was transferred to a part of the building of the São Bento da Saúde Monastery, on the Calçada da Estrela side, occupying the facilities called Casa dos Bispos and contiguous compartments, which were leased to the monastery. It was then necessary to proceed with its installation, and its organization: the bundles from the Casa da Coroa, were organized in a Chronological Body collection, and in a Fragments collection. The officials of the archive made several copies of documents, namely the Reform of Drawers, the Reform of Old Forals, and the Collection of Copies. They continued the work of description of documents, which resulted in the indexes of the Chronological Body (1764), the summaries and indexes of the documents of the Drawers (1765), the indexes of the books of the Menus (1765), the indexes of the bundles of the Royal House Houses and Officials (1767, 1770), and the inventory of the documents of the Crown's House (1776). Some of these instruments of description can still be consulted today at the Reference Service.\r\n\r\nFrom 1777 onwards, by the Regiment of August 1st, the registry books of the end of the reigns were obliged to be sent to the Torre do Tombo. In 1791, by Notice dated February 5th, the General Registry of Mercês was transferred to the Torre do Tombo, and continued to operate in this institution until 1927.\r\n\r\nIn the early 19th century, the duties of the Archives were extended to the training of civil servants, and to the teaching of Diplomatics, with the creation of the Diplomatics Classroom.\r\n\r\nUntil 1823, the Archives were subject to the Council of the Treasury, although they also depended on other institutions during the period of the Ancien Regime. From then until 1887, it depended on the General Directorate of Public Instruction of the Ministry of the Kingdom.\r\n\r\nDuring the liberal period, the Torre do Tombo, designated as the National Archives in the 1823 Regulations, or as the Royal Archives of the Torre do Tombo, was called upon to perform much wider-ranging duties, initiating a new phase in institutional life, marked by the incorporation of documents from the archives of the abolished courts of the Ancien Regime, in 1821 and 1833, and from the registry offices of the religious corporations, abolished by Decree on May 28th, 1834. There were four major cycles of incorporations throughout the 19th century, from various institutions, which contributed to the disorganization of the collections, which were not complete.\r\n\r\nIn this environment of growing documentation in the Archives, the Provisional Regulations of 30th April 1823 called for the creation of different types of indexes, and recommended the preservation of the order of the documents.\r\n\r\nThe new Regulations published in 1839 charged the Archives with the duty of incorporating documents deemed unnecessary to the institutions themselves and those of extinct bodies, ensuring their proper preservation and installation.\r\n\r\nThe Law of 2 October 1862 established that all consignments of documents must be accompanied by the respective inventories, drawn up according to their provenance.\r\n\r\nIn the 19th century, the Archives suffered from a shortage of staff, who were divided among the Secretariat of the Mercês Registry, and from poor facilities. These were only improved in 1861, when the Torre do Tombo Archives moved to the right wing of the monastery, on the Rua de São Bento side.\r\n\r\nAlthough it invested in document description, the conception of an archive as a public service for the disclosure of document contents was a late arrival: the public consultation of the Torre do Tombo documents began timidly, in 1901, by Decree of December 24th, being foreseen for the scholars to whom the conservators had to give support.\r\n\r\nThe Decree of 18th March 1911 reorganized the library and archive services under the Directorate-General for Secondary, Higher and Special Education, definitively designated the National Archives of the Torre do Tombo as the National Archives, emphasized its role in the conservation and promotion of manuscripts intended for the study of History, as well as in promoting the entry of copies of Portuguese manuscripts from abroad, and established, for the first time, public opening hours.\r\n\r\nOver the last hundred years, the National Archive has grown significantly with the integration of several archival services: the Archives of the Completed Trials (in 1915, by Decree no. 1659, of 15th June), and the Archives of the National Archives of Portugal (in 1916, by Decree no. 1659, of 15th June). In the last hundred years, the National Archive has grown significantly, with the integration of various archive services: the Archives of Findings (in 1915, by Decree no. 1659, of 15th June), the Archive of Parochial Records, accumulating the functions of Lisbon District Archive (from 1918 to 1992), the Archive of Congregations (in 1930), the Historical Archive of the Ministry of Finance (in 1992) and more recently the Lisbon service of the Portuguese Photography Centre (2007).\r\n\r\nIn 1931, by Decree no. 19,592, of 31st June, the National Archive was designated as the General Archive, and became technically and administratively subject to the Inspection of Erudite Libraries and Archives, which in 1965 became the responsibility of the General Directorate for Higher Education and Fine Arts of the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\nSince 1985, the National Archive has depended on the Ministry of Culture with administrative autonomy. In 1927, 1931, 1933 and 1965, the remaining district archives were created, to which the Inspectorate sent the documents still existing in the Treasury's departments.\r\n\r\nThus, in 1988, the Portuguese Archives Institute was created by Decree-Law no. 152/88, of 29th April, and remained in operation until 1992, when it merged with the National Archives of the Torre do Tombo, by Decree-Law no. 106-G/92, of 1st June, taking the name of National Archives/Torre do Tombo (AN/TT).\r\n\r\nAfter 1990, when the National Archives were moved to the purpose-built building in Alameda da Universidade, with larger premises, new additions occurred, namely, in 1992, with the addition of the documentation of the Secretaries of State, mentioned in Article 25 of the Law of March 1911, followed by many other acquisitions.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the national archival policy, extended to the production of documents and the management of current archives, to document evaluation and selection and to intermediate archives, was reflected in the change of name of the National Archives, renamed Instituto dos Arquivos Nacionais/Torre do Tombo (IAN/TT). From 1997, in accordance with the organic law published in Decree-Law no. 60/97, of 20th March, it has been responsible for promoting and implementing national archival policy, in terms of preserving and enhancing national archival heritage, promoting the quality of current archives, and safeguarding and guaranteeing the rights of the State and citizens.\r\n\r\nIts own identity was recovered in 2007 by the organic law, and it was re-designated Arquivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo, becoming a national scope archive dependent on the Directorate-General of Archives.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, under the Central Administration Reduction and Improvement Plan (PREMAC) in line with the organic law of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, established by Decree-Law No. 126 -A/2011, of 29 December and in accordance with Decree-Law No. 103/2012 of 16 May 2012. 103/2012 of 16th May, which establishes the organic structure of the Directorate-General of Books, Archives and Libraries, (which results from the merger of the Directorate-General of Books and Libraries with the Directorate-General of Archives), the National Archives of the Torre do Tombo is now an integral service of this Directorate-General. By the same diploma, the Lisbon District Archive is reintegrated into the Torre do Tombo.\r\n\r\nSince then, the National Archives of Torre do Tombo is a central organic unit, as a service dependent on the Directorate General of Books, Archives and Libraries , as per Ordinance no. 192/2012, of 19 June, and its competences were fixed by Order no. 9339/2012, of 27 June."

                        "history": "The present Jewish Community of Lisbon originated in the Sephardic Jewish Groups that have settled in Portugal in the early XIX Century. They were mainly tradesmen, coming from Gibraltar and Morocco (Tangier, Tetouan and Mogador) and some of their names still expressed a connection to their Iberic lands of origin, before the period they were expelled from there. That is the case of CONQUI (from Cuenca, province of Cuenca) or CARDOSO (from Cardoso, Viseu District).\r\n\r\nThey were above average-learned people, knowing how to read and write and speaking, besides the liturgical Hebrew, the Arabic or English and Haquitia, a Jewish-Hispanic-Moroccan dialect. They had numerous international contacts, not only due to their trading activities but also to their family ties spread around the world. These factors explain the quick economic and cultural flourishing not only of Lisbon Jews but also of the groups that have been settling on the first half of the XIX Century in the Azores and in Faro.\r\n\r\nParallel to their fast and successful integration in the Portuguese way of life, the first Jewish groups have sought to organize themselves as such, creating prayer lounges and acquiring plots to bury their dead loved ones according to the Jewish Ritual. The first grave belongs to José Amzalak, departed in February 26th 1804 and buried in a plot belonging to the English Cemetery of Estrela, definitely due to the British nationality of the first Jews in Lisbon, that came, as we have seen, from Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nBy this time, Jews were still considered as a foreign colony and the community had no legal existence yet. The Constitutional Charter of 1826 only recognized Catholicism as the sole religion allowed to Portuguese citizens, referring all the other creeds to foreigners. That is why back then it was called the Israeli “colony”, just like the English or German colonies were.\r\n\r\nSince legalization of the community was not possible to get, Jews in Lisbon, especially in the second half of the XIX Century, decided to create charity institutions in the form of autonomous associations, which statutes were submitted for approval to the Civil Government or in the form of private foundations, usually managed by Ladies. These institutions have played a key role in the unity and organization of Portuguese Judaism. We will mention only three:\r\n\r\nSomej-Nophlim (Protection to the Poor): created in 1865 by Simão Anahory with the aim to help the poor. Later, in 1916, this association opens the Israeli Hospital that played an important role in supporting Israeli refugees during the Second World War.\r\n\r\nGuemilut Hassadim: founded in 1892 by Moses Anahory to minister spiritual aid and deal with the Jewish burials.\r\n\r\nEconomic Kitchen: founded in 1899, it played, like the Israeli Hospital, an important role during the World War II.\r\n\r\nAnother decisive step to the formation of the present Jewish Community of Lisbon is taken in 1894 with the achievement of a General Assembly of Jews in Lisbon with the aim of unify the Shehitá services (ritual slaughter and provision of kosher meat). Under the push of Isaac Levy and Simão Anahory, in 1897, a process that leads to the creation of an organizing committee to build a unique synagogue and the election of the I Committee of the Israeli Community in Lisbon begins, having Abraham Bensaúde as its Honorary President and Simão Anahory as the Effective President.\r\n\r\nSince 1810 there were several prayer houses in Lisbon, but they hardly had the required conditions to the worship service, since they were located on humble apartments. Nevertheless, despite the difficulties caused by the lack of official recognition, the community manages to buy, under the name of private individuals, a ground for the construction of a new building, proper and decent.\r\n\r\nThe authorship of the synagogue’s project belonged to one of the greatest architects of that time, Miguel Ventura Terra. Located at nr 59 of Rua Alexandre Herculano, it had to be built inside a walled yard, since it was not allowed to build the façade facing the public street as it was not a Catholic temple, faith which was the official State religion at the time.\r\n\r\nThe First Stone being layed in 1902, the Shaaré-Tikva Synagogue is finally inaugurated in 1904, ending a more than 50 years’ effort from the Jews in Lisbon.\r\n\r\nThe first step to the official recognition of Israeli Community of Lisbon dates from 1868, when the Government grants a Permit, through a Charter from King D. Luís that gives “Jews from Lisbon the permission to establish a cemetery to bury their co-religionists”. This is the old Calçada das Lages Cemetery, presently known as Afonso III Cemetery, which is still an active cemetery to this day.\r\n\r\nThis Royal diploma has a true historical importance, since it is an implicit, though non-formal, acknowledgement of the Israeli Community of Lisbon. Actually, this one will only be officially recognized by the Republican Government in 1912, precisely 416 years after the Edict of Expulsion and almost a century after the Inquisition’s extinction.\r\n\r\nThe official recognition of the community and construction of the synagogue gave a new boost to the community’s life in Lisbon. Thus, soon in 1912 the Hebrew Studies Association “Ubá le Zion” is created, whose great promoter was Adolfo Benarus, professor of the Faculty of Letters of Lisbon, writer and educator, founder of the Israeli School too, in 1929, school that once had nearly 100 students.\r\n\r\nThe creation of a bulletin, directed by Joseph Benoliel, a bond between the members of the community, the organization of a Library in 1915 and the foundation of the Hehaver Israeli Youth Association in 1925 were other mark stones of the Israeli Community of Lisbon’s consolidation.\r\n\r\nYet, from that time on, the community will experience, as a result of the European events, a deep change both in terms of its action and of its composition. The anti-Semitic persecutions in the east and the fast rise of Nazism in Germany lead to the arrival into Portugal of the first Ashkenazi Jews that quickly adapt to the Portuguese society and the Israeli Community. The outbreak of World War II, the neutrality policy to which Portugal referred to in the framework of the alliance with England and the granting of transit visas to nearly one hundred thousand refugees originated an influx of tens of thousands of Jews to Portugal. The few who stayed changed the mostly Sephardic proportions of the Lisbon community.\r\n\r\nPortuguese Jews played an important role during this period in supporting these refugees, first through the creation of the “Portuguese Commission for Assistance to the Refugee-Jews in Portugal” (COMASSIS) directed by Augusto Esaguy, and later straightly led through the Community's own refugee-support section, chaired by Moisés Amzalak and whose great animator was Elias Baruel. Funded by Joint and other international Jewish institutions, the community kept the Economic Kitchen and the Israeli Hospital, providing daily meals, clothes and healthcare to refugees.\r\n\r\nUntil the 60s the community has remained demographically stable, but the creation of the State of Israel and the outbreak of the Colonial War led to the departure of some families. Today, though decreased in number and tending towards a progressive assimilation, the community maintains its essential services running: Synagogue, Cemetery, Social Center and the Somej Nophlim Charitable Association.\r\n\r\nThe political opening corresponding to the post-revolution of April and the opening of Portuguese borders after Portugal joined the European Union has brought to our country Jewish citizens originating from various countries, from Europe and Brazil. These arrivals, if they keep on accelerating, may give a new layout to the Jewish community in Portugal."

The state archives are made up of one major archive in Bucharest and multiple county branch archives. Several other state archives have their own archival system and collections. These include the Military National Archives of Romania, the Diplomatic Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Council for the Study of Securitate Archives.\r\n\r\nAccess to data in the NAR benefited from a protocol signed between NAR and the EHRI partner in Romania, the ‘Elie Wiesel’ National Institute for the Study of Holocaust in Romania.

For these institutions, EHRI has made over 1,000 Holocaust-relevant archival descriptions available. In the NAR, EHRI identified documents on actions of the Jewish Central Office in Romania, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Work, Health and Social Protection, Presidency of the Council of Ministers. These collections cover administrative, political and judicial orders, decisions, reports, issued by Romanian authorities related to administration in Romania, Bessarabia, Bukovina and Transnistria. In the Military Archives, EHRI identified documents concerning military decisions mainly covering the Romanian governorates in Bessarabia, Bukovina Transnistria.\r\n\r\n**C.II.

                "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Serbia: Pre-existing research, third-party surveys and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Serbia, EHRI could rely on a number of pre-existing works on the Holocaust in Serbia. Some important websites that are also very useful for locating the historical sources include:\r\n- killingsites.org: a website about the killing sites around Belgrade where the Jews were shot in 1941. The website is the result of an international project and there are several archival documents available.\r\n- holokaust.arhiv-beograda.org: a website about the victims of the Sajmiste concentration camp with a list of victims and archival documents from the Historical Archive of Belgrade.\r\n- topovskesupe.rs: a website for the Mapping the Holocaust – The Topovske Šupe Camp project, which aims to present a digitized history of the Topovske Šupe camp to the public. It contains various archival material related to the camp and its victims.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Serbia’s archival situation and specific challenges**\r\nThe most relevant Holocaust repositories and collections in Serbia are:\r\n\r\n*The Serbian Military Archives* \r\n\r\n- *Collection of Microfilms relating to the German occupation from 1941 to 1945*\r\n\r\nThis fonds contains documentation concerning German military units and authorities in Yugoslavia. The material is arranged and processed following geographical and thematic sets. Many documents are copies from the Freiburg Military Archives.\r\n\r\n- *Serbian Government of Milan Nedic 1941-1945 fond*\r\n\r\nAccess to the military archive is very limited for non-Serbian citizens and they have to follow a particular procedure for obtaining the permission to conduct research in the Military Archives.\r\n\r\n*Archives of Yugoslavia*\r\n\r\n- *The State Commission for the Investigation of the Crimes of Occupiers and their Supporters fond*\r\n\r\nThe fonds contains strictly classified, original documents of the Nazi occupiers and their local fascist allies, as well as testimonies and inquiries conducted by Yugoslav authorities immediately after the war in order to record all the crimes committed against civilians in Yugoslavia and seek out and prosecute those responsible.\r\n\r\n- *The Royal Yugoslav Government-in-exile*\r\n\r\nDocuments on the Holocaust can also be found in this fonds. Many of these documents are reports which were sent from occupied Yugoslavia to the Royal Yugoslav Government in London.\r\n\r\n*The Historical Archives of Belgrade*\r\n\r\n- *Commander of Security Police and Security Services BdS/Befehlshaber der Sicherheitspolizei und des Sicherheitsdienstes fond*\r\n\r\nIn this fonds, there is a focus on Gestapo documents, particularly personal dossiers, and it is considered one of the few intact Gestapo document collections in all of Europe.\r\n\r\n- *Belgrade City Administration fond*\r\n\r\nDragi Jovanović, president of the Administration of the City of Belgrade, was one of the most reliable allies of the Nazi occupiers. The Special Police operated under his command, and in particular, the Police Department for Jews and Gypsies, which played an active role in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\n- *The Municipality of Belgrade fond*\r\n\r\nThe Municipality of Belgrade was in charge of administering the city. For this reason, this fonds contains materials concerning daily life in Belgrade during the Second World War.\r\n\r\n*The Jewish Historical Museum of Belgrade*\r\n\r\nEven though the Jewish Historical Museum does not have a particularly large collection dedicated to the Holocaust (the material mostly consists of copies from other archives), some interesting documents, such as the survivors’ testimonies, are very useful.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Serbia**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Serbia**\r\n\r\nEHRI identified several Holocaust repositories in Serbia and focused on four of the most relevant: the Archives of Yugoslavia, the Military Archive, the Historical Archive of Belgrade and the Jewish Historical Museum. \r\nDuring the research survey multiple fonds were selected and hundreds of documents were consulted and described. Approximately, these fonds represent more than 80% of the available documents in Serbia covering the Holocaust in German-occupied Serbia. They cover other topics as well, including the flight of Jews from Serbia and the Independent State of Croatia to the Italian controlled territories, the killing of the Jews from Bačka under Hungarian occupation in the Bor copper mines, and the crimes in the Independent State of Croatia.\r\n\r\nLocal archives preserve information about the small Jewish communities in other cities (Niš, Kragujevac, Sabac and others), while the Archives of Vojvodina preserve documents that are primarily concerned with the killing of the Jews from Novi Sad and the Bačka region under Hungarian, and later Nazi, control. Also located in Novi Sad, the Museum of Vojvodina’s Holocaust-relevant holdings have been described in the EHRI Portal.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nEven though a detailed survey of archives outside of Serbia has not yet been conducted, we note that documents related to the Holocaust in Serbia are preserved in German repositories, such as the Bundesarchiv and the Arolsen Archives. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has also collected many relevant documents, while the Russian State Military Archive should hold the records of the Serbian Jewish communities before and during WWII.",

The idea about a museum collection was born even before, back in 1825, when it was first mentioned on the pages of the literary magazine \"Annals of Matica Srpska\". This idea came into reality on October 14, 1847, when a decision was made to found the Serbian National Collection or the Museum, saying “it will be the venue, where all the antiques and valuables will be kept”.\r\nThe first museum collection stems from Sava Tekelija’s rich legacy. Following a multi- decade long committed work, this collection had grown to become the Museum of Matica Srpska, and as such, it was opened on July 9, 1933. in Novi Sad, where Matica Srpska had been moved from Budapest in 1864.\r\nOn 30th May 1947, with the goal to establish a central museum covering the entire territory of Vojvodina, a section was taken out of the material kept at Matica Srpska Museum, and that is how the Vojvodina Museum was founded as a complex museum with several collections covering archaeology, ethnology, history, history of art, zoology, botanics, geology-palaeonthology and minerology-pethrography. At the same time, the Museum was assigned to do professional supervision over all museums in the Province. \r\nSubsequently several further institutions emerged from the Vojvodina Museum and one of them was the Museum of the Working-Class Movement and the National Revolution, founded in 1956.\r\nThis museum and the Archives of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of Serbia for Vojvodina were integrated in 1971. and became the Museum of Socialist Revolution - later the Historical Museum of Vojvodina.\r\nFinally, on May 20th 1992, the Vojvodina Museum joined the Vojvodina Historical Museum to become the Museum of Vojvodina.\r\n"

The funds of these two institutions served as the basis on which, according to a political decision, the new museum was established. Even though this musealization of Yugoslavia was supposed to “put it on the shelf” in accordance with the understanding of a museum as a storage place for “old and unnecessary things”, it turned out that the collections, histories, documentation and employees of these two institutions became the basis of a twenty years long search for ways of acknowledging Yugoslavia as a heritage.\r\n"

                        "history": "The Matica Srpska Library is the oldest Serbian national library and the first public and scientific library of Serbs. It was founded in 1826, in Pest, together with the foundation of the Matica Srpska Literary Society. It was only natural for the books to find their place in such a literary society. The intention of the founders, led by Jovan Hadzic was „to develop the literature and the education of the Serbian people, i.e. to publish Serbian books and publicize them\". The first issues of Letopis Matice srpske, which appeared in 1824, first book editions and gifts from Russia, as well as other books unknown to us, were the core of the Matica Srpska Library. It was officially opened for its readers on 26 August, 1838 „for the Slavonic people of any language or origin, who are welcome to enter and read the books\". It was situated in Tekelijanum, the institute supporting Serbian students in Pest. This Institute was founded by Sava Tekelija, the president and patron of Matica SrpskaThe Library received its first known gift from Atanasije Stojkovic in 1832. In the same year, it began to exchange books with the Russian Academy of Science. From April 1839, the Library received more and more books. The first large personal libraries were received from Platon Atanackovic and Sava Tekelija. The Matica Srpska Library was already known as the largest Serbian library. A lot of other people also donated books at that time: Teodor Pavlovic, Dimitrije Tirol, Vuk Karadzic, Petar II Petrovic Njegos, Jovan Subotic, Jan Kolar and others.\r\n\r\nIn the period from 1848 to 1849 both the Library and Matica Srpska were closed.\r\n\r\nIn 1864, the Library and the Society were moved to Novi Sad, where they continued their successful development. In that period, the stock of the library was increased through purchases, subscriptions and, especially, through exchange of the Matica Srpska publications for publications of the academies of science, universities, literary and cultural societies and journal publishers from all Slavonic and most European countries, as well as through the purchase or donation of private libraries, libraries of different institutions and societies.\r\n\r\nThe Library was professionally organized in 1842-1843 by writer Jovan Subotic. He prepared and published the first Serbian current bibliography in Letopis Matice srpske (1842-1847).\r\n\r\nJovan Djordjevic, a man of literature and the theatre, as well as the Matica Srpska secretary from 1857 to 1859, was the first to suggest a concept according to which the Matica Srpska Library should become a national library. He proposed that all Serbian books and periodicals, Slavonic books and all publications about the Serbian people should be collected. He also proposed that university library should be founded in Tekelianum.\r\n\r\nJovan Radonic, historian, was the librarian from 1899 to 1905 and in The Library Rules, he established the principles of planned acquisition, the protection and usage of books and periodicals, and gave the basic principles for setting up a catalogue.\r\n\r\nBetween the two World Wars, the Matica Srpska Library continued its activities as a public and scientific library. As a public library, its intentions were always to make the books as accessible to the readers as possible. As a scientific library, it provided resources that served for studies on Vojvodina, which was the aim of the Matica Srpska Society. The universal character of its collections, the successful exchange with Yugoslav and foreign libraries, as well as the needs of scientists from Novi Sad and other Yugoslav centers, encouraged the development of its functions as a general scientific library.\r\n\r\nDuring both World Wars, the Library was closed and its stocks, fortunately, remained almost untouched.\r\n\r\nAfter the Second World War, the Library underwent intensive development in various directions. In 1948 the Matica Srpska Library became the Central Library of Vojvodina and started to receive a sample copy of all the publications in Serbia, and in 1965 all of Yugoslavia. It became an independent institution in 1958. Ever since the University of Novi Sad was founded (1960), the Library has contributed to the development of research work at the University by practically functioning as a university library as well. From 1948 to 1994, it was the central library for all the libraries in Vojvodina and after that, for all the academic and scientific libraries. In accordance to the Law on Library Work (1994), the National Library of Serbia cooperates with the Matica Srpska Library in the realization of the general interests of library activities in the Republic.\r\n\r\nSince 2003 the Matica Srpska Library has started again to be the central library for all the libraries in Vojvodina organizing expert exams for librarians as well.\r\n\r\nWith its rich collections offering excellent opportunities for cultural, historical and scientific research, and the variety of library and information services, the Matica Srpska Library is a modern library of Yugoslav significance. Its long and continuing existence places the Matica Srpska Library among the institutions of the Serbian people with the longest tradition."

                        "history": "The National Library of Serbia was founded in 1832, and it is the oldest cultural institution in Serbia. It was created as a special depository of books, then as a library within the Ministry of Education, and since then the library gathered many libraries, public and state authorities and bought out several private libraries ( Lukijan Mušicki, Josip Schlesinger), which have grown over time into the National Library.\r\n\r\nIn 1845, the library had 1421 titles in 2283 volumes and an authors` catalogue, developed by Milovan Spasić, Ph.D. By the order of the Prince in 1853, the profession of State Librarian was introduced, in the rank of a high school professor. The name of the “National Library” was established by Djura Daničić, who defined the national conception of the purchasing policy and began compiling the current national bibliography. Stojan Novaković was the first legislator of the Library. By his merit, and through the Press Law of 1870, the privilege of legal deposit was established, and the Library was separated from the Ministry of Education and Church Business at which time the publishing activity started. More laws regarding the National Library were promulgated during that period, up to 1901. These are the Serbian Royal Academy of Sciences Act, which gave the right to the Academy to supervise the work of the Library, hence the National Library Act, which defined the main tasks of the Library as: a) to aid the development of science in Serbia, b) to facilitate the spread of mass education and c) to handle the Serbian bibliography. At that time, the Library received the first regulation of its internal organization and work.\r\nThe First World War brought a lot of misfortune to the Library. The bombing destroyed a part of its holdings, and the remaining collections were moved for safety to several different places in Belgrade, Niš and Kosovska Mitrovica. A part of the collections ended up in Sofia, but was returned after the war. A lot of the library materials, manuscripts, books and newspapers disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe Press Law and the new National Library Act from 1919 provided the Library with the status of the central state library and the right to acquire an obligatory copy from the entire territory of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The compilation of the current bibliography of Yugoslavia began in 1928. The international format of the catalogue card was adopted in the Library in 1938. The journal of the National Library, “The Herald”, began with issue in 1940. \r\n\r\nDuring the Second World War, on April 6th 1941, during the bombing of Belgrade, the complete library was burnt to the ground. A great part of the holdings, catalogues and inventory, were destroyed at that time. The reconstruction of the library holdings began during the war, and was intensified after the war. \r\n\r\nThe Library acquired new, arranged catalogues, so that in 1947 the Author Catalogue and in 1948 the Subject Catalogue were developed. In 1953, the Library Center was founded, which grew into the Department of Development and Research of the Library and Information Science. The Bibliographical Department was founded in 1960, with the aim of compiling the Serbian retrospective bibliography, and in the same year the Archeographical Department was founded with the purpose of describing and registering the South Slavic Cyrillic manuscripts, and reconstructing the manuscript collection. At that time, the Conservation laboratory was created for the protection of the library’s material as well as for scientific and experimental research on books and papers.\r\n\r\nBy the Serbian Libraries Act from 1965, the National Library, as the central parent library in Serbia, was given a special position and many important functions. \r\n\r\nOn the anniversary of the bombing destruction, April 6th 1973, the Library solemnly opened the doors of its new building, where it is still situated today. Following year, in 1974, the Specialized Catalogue was formed, according to the UDC, then the Central Catalogue of Serbia and the Center for Scientific Information were established too. In 1976, the Library adopted the new regulations of cataloguing and switched to a new, international standard of bibliographic description - the ISBD. Preparations were made for switching to automatic data processing. \r\n\r\nThe Library had started with the cataloguing of publications before printing in 1987, making the cataloguing records for the monographs in publication, the CIP – Cataloguing in Publication, including a majority of editions in the country. The computerized catalogue of the National Library of Serbia was established in 1989. Since the catalogue included the entire newly acquired material, in 1991, it suspended the making of the card catalogues.\r\nIn 1996, the Library obtained its local computer library network, when the access to Internet was facilitated and the first web site presentation of the National Library of Serbia was made. \r\nSince 2000, the Library has made important steps, in the first place regarding its opening towards the world, whereby the Center for International Cooperation received a more intensive and important role. The Center for Scientific Information initiated the foundation of the Consortium of Libraries in Serbia for common acquisition (KoBSON), which facilitated access to the huge foreign electronic databases and journals, with over 13.000 online titles. A great number of projects have been launched. One of them is the foundation of the Center of the Virtual Library of Serbia (VLS), which connects the electronic catalogues of all libraries in Serbia in an unique shared electronic catalogue."

It was yet another manifestation of celebrating Serbia's Independence. First permanent display was opened in 1904 according to 100th Anniversary of First Serbian Uprising and as a part of King Petar's Coronation Ceremonies.\r\nMuseum was then placed in a humble building from Turkish period, just beside the Roman Well. Soon after the foundation, Museum has entered the Europe by participating on the Balkan Expo in London in 1907. There, with around 100 carefully chosen objects, Museum had attracted the attention of London public and it was described in local newspapers.\r\n \r\nMuseum’s building was demolished in First World War, and collections were mostly destroyed or were seized by occupation troops. Again more than two decades had past before the new Display has been opened. King Aleksandar I Karadjordjević issued a Decree of Founding the Military Museum in Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Brigadier Vojislav Vuković, majordom of Royal Court became a director of Military Museum. Systematical collecting of objects started and numerous donors, former soldiers and their descendants responded. Their names were signed in a special „Golden Book“, work of a famous Russian artist Vsevolod Guljevič. The book is still being kept in the Military Museum.\r\nNew permanent Display was opened in 1937 in two buildings of which one is today a residence of City Bureau for Preserving of Monuments.\r\nDuring the Second World War collections suffered new devastation. However, according to the program of occupation troops, some cultural institutions with military Museum among them continued their work during the occupation. Collecting of objects and their preserving was main care for museum staff. Allied bombing of Belgrade in 1944 brought new destroying of museum buildings and collections. In new conditions, after the Second World War, new work on collecting objects started, especially from the previous war. Also adaptation of Display began in accordance to new ideology. Museum collections were significantly enriched, especially with objects from War and Revolution, and Military Museum became an important institution of new country. Great attention was given to acquisitions, expert personnel, researching, archaeological excavations and preparing of new display in which beside museum experts, many prominent historians, archaeologists, architects and various artists participated. New display was opened in 1961 by president Josip Broz Tito.\r\nAll important foreign delegations in Yugoslavia were guests of Military Museum. Museum organized large number of various exhibitions; edited several memorial complexes and commemorative rooms; issued several monographies, catalogues and other publications. Museum participated in symposiums and similar conferences I country and abroad. Special attention is given to acquisition of new objects and forming of collections. Today, Museum has around 33.000 objects in 15 collections and very impressive photo collection with over 100.000 photographs.\r\nMuseum has special library with over 15.000 titles from areas of History, History of Art, Archaeology, Museology and other similar branches of Science and with more than 6000 magazines.\r\n"

                        "history": "The Memorial park October in Kragujevac was established in 1953 on site where in October 1941 a few thousand citizens from Kragujevac were shot – Serbs, Jews, Roma people, Muslims, Macedonians, Slovenians and members of other nationalities. This terrible crime was committed in Kragujevac and the surrounding villages, over the male population aged between twelve and sixty five.\r\n\r\nThe Memorial park takes up the area of 352 ha where there are 30 mass tombs. The area has been laid out by the urban project of two architects Mihailo Mitrovic and Radivoje Tomiæ. Up till today over ten tombs there are ten sculptural-architectonic unities. One of them, the Monument to the shot pupils and teachers is a true symbol of the city.\r\n\r\nThe Museum 21st October was founded within the Memorial park on 15th February 1976 with the aim of gathering, processing, keeping and presenting the documents concerning the shooting and the victims, through exhibitions and printed material. Apart from that, The Memorial Park organizes the traditional manifestations, whereas the exhibitions the modern art exhibitions are organized in the City gallery The Balkan Bridges, opened on 7th April 2005.\r\n\r\nEvery year since 1971 the central manifestation of paying tribute has been held next to the Monument of shot pupils and teachers by the name of The Great School Lesson. Original works with peaceful messages, made by renowned domestic and foreign authors and composers are chosen for the occasion, and among the performers there are most famous actors, opera soloists and choirs.\r\n\r\nThe traditional music manifestation The Pilgrimage of October- OKTOH has been held since 1975. Young artists from the country and abroad perform the works of famous composers.\r\n\r\nFor over thirty years an open literary-visual arts competition One Šumarice is enough to the world is held for pupils of elementary and secondary schools from the territory of ex- Yugoslavia. Each November the ceremony of giving awards is organized and the first prizes on the topics of anti-war character or the topics about children`s rights, with the aim to encourage the young people to think about the right, ethical values.\r\n\r\nDuring the period 2002 and 2007 there was the International Visual Arts Colony  The Balkan bridges in Šumarice, and from 2008 it turned into the International Biannual of digital graphics. Our institution promotes the idea of open-mindedness, tolerance and versatility as a way for reconciliation among young people.\r\n\r\nThe Memorial Park was declared the cultural heritage of extreme importance on 27th December 1979.\r\n\r\nThe October in Kragujevac Memorial Park`s mission is to nurture and keep the memory of this tragic event; to raise the awareness and educate the coming generations so that such a crime is never repeated again."

                        "history": "On 19 February 2009, by decision of the Government of the Republic of Serbia, the Archives of Yugoslavia were founded as a cultural institution. With this decision its old name was returned – the Archives of Yugoslavia, instead of the Archives of Serbia and Montenegro, their name since 2003. The activities of the Archives have remained unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe internal structure of the Archives of Yugoslavia followed, developed and were fine-tuned simultaneously with the development of the needs and opportunities for the protection of archival records at state level.\r\n\r\nIn the period following its establishment, namely from 1950 - 1959 the structure of the Archives reflected and dovetailed with the main tasks, which were primarily to locate, register, gather and sort public records for which the Archives were responsible. In 1959, the Federal Executive Council adopted its first act laying down the structure of the Archives. It was important not only in that it was the first such act passed by a public authority but also in that it established a separate department within the Archives for the information on archival records. This was an indicator of the fact that, in the period until that date, the Archives had managed to complete a large number of technical tasks with its records that were now in a condition that made it possible to use them and get more detailed information about the holdings and collections.\r\n\r\nThe next act on the structure of the Archives was passed in 1965, which determined its definite structure. It was much more complex than before and had well-defined structural segments each responsible for a particular type of technical duties. This structure included a separate segment for the protection of archival records outside the Archives; namely, a library was established. The sorting out and processing of archival material took place in two separate structural segments depending on the periodisation of the holdings in question.\r\n\r\nThe new structure was put in place in 1973 following the adoption of the Law on the Archives for the first time providing for the establishment of a department for the special protection of archival records and a somewhat changed structure for the sorting out and processing of public records. According to the structure in place in 1978 when the Archives was once again incorporated into the government administration structure, the duties were divided up between two departments: the first covered archival duties and the second - legal and technical protection of archival records. Lower-level structural segments - sections were introduced, too. \r\n\r\nThe structure of the Archives in 1979 and 1980 included, for the first time, a research group as a separate structural segment. The sorting out and processing of records took place within the structural segments that were set up depending on the activity of the entities producing holdings and collections.\r\nFurther changes in the Archives' structure (until 2000) made it possible for a large number of duties to be streamlined in terms of human and technical resources.\r\nThe structure of the Archives in 2000 included two departments: the department for supervision, protection, sorting out, processing and use of archival records and the department for the application of information technologies, publishing of archival records, cultural and educational activity and international cooperation. In addition to the two departments, there was also a Section for Legal and Administrative Affairs. \r\nIn 2003 the first Act on the Structure of the Archives was passed within the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. The duties are performed by three departments as the main structural segments notably: the department for the protection of archival records, information and use; the department for sorting out and processing of archival records; and the department for IT applying and technical protection of archival records. Within each of these departments there are two lower-level structural segments - (5) units and (1) desk. Apart from these three departments, there is also a separate Legal, Material-Financial and Administrative Affairs Section. The salient features of this structure of the Archives are the following: the activities of the Archives are accurately defined; the performance of the duties and tasks presupposes an adequate working methodology and personnel; the technological process for a particular technical assignment or task is complete and structural segments are coherent and mutually interlinked making it possible to achieve maximum efficiency throughout the Archives.\r\nWhen the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro ceased to exist in May 2006, the Republic of Serbia became an independant state and acquired successor state status. The Republic of Serbia, based on the Decree on Financing Competencies, which were transferred from the former state union to the Republic of Serbia, has continued to finance competencies of the Archives of Serbia and Montenegro. The Archives of Serbia and Montenegro existed under this name from 2003 until 19th February 2009, when by the Decision of the Government of the Republic of Serbia the Archives of Yugoslavia was established, as a cultural institution.\r\n"

As former Federation of the Jewish Communities of Yugoslavia, the FJCS preserves in its library and its museum (the Historical Jewish Museum) a large number of books, archival sources and other materials concerning the life of the Jewish community, mainly during the XIX and XX centuries.\r\nThe history of the Library of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Serbia dates back to right after the World War One when, at the initiative of the then President of the Sephardic Jewish Community, Dr. David Albala, the „Serbian – Jewish Youth Community“ was founded, which organized different cultural events, performances and lectures in the hall of the Jewish home Oneg Šabat (currently these premises are the “Sinema Rex”).\r\n\r\nThis institution, in cultural terms, was the predecessor of the Jewish Reading Room, which was founded in 1929 at the initiative of Aron Alkalaj, as the Cultural Centre of Belgrade Jews. \r\nDuring WWII, the archives and the documentation of the Jewish Reading Room was practically completely destroyed, including also most of the books in its library fund.\r\n\r\nThe Library was renewed immediately after the WWII within the overall revitalization of the Jewish community in Yugoslavia, including cultural activities in the new Yugoslavia. Its initial library fund consisted of the Judaica. Olga Pops-Timotijević separated the Judaica from a branch of the Berlin University which, already during the war, through unusual coincidences, ended up in Belgrade and was housed in the publishing house Borba."

                        "history": "History of the Diplomatic Archive of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic archive of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is based on former activities of the diplomatic archive of the Kingdom of Serbia and Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\nIt was founded soon after the creation of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. As the date of foundation 05 May 1919 is taken, when the Decree of organization of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (MIP), diplomatic and consular missions of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, was passed. As one of the organization units, the Main Archive was founded on the basis of the Decree, and it consisted of Documentation and Library of the Ministry, taken over from the Ministry of the Kingdom of Serbia and Montenegro. The Main Archive started to operate more effectively in the fall of 1924 since it was then that the Minister of Foreign Affairs formed an expert commission whose task was to inspect gathered documents on the creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and make a plan of future operation of the Main archive.\r\nThe Law on archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and diplomatic and consular missions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia abroad has from 05 April 1930 been precise in stating which holdings of the archive would become part of the Main Archive. Those were the archives of former Ministries of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Serbia and the Kingdom of Montenegro and their missions abroad, as well as foreign diplomatic and consular archives or correspondence, which belong to our country according to international contracts, or which were given to the State by foreign states, to preserve. Under the same conditions, the Law protected private archives as well, which had, as a gift, by means of purchase or any other, become part of any of the archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or missions of the Kingdom abroad.\r\n\r\nEver since that time, destroyed documents or damaged papers are being reconstructed; the scientific and other research is granted to private persons according to regulations; diplomatic documents of interest for the national history are being published; the research in foreign archives and papers of foreign documents concerning the national history; arrangement and preservation of holdings of interest to our diplomatic history; participation in signing and implementation of international contracts and conventions concerning the archives.\r\nBy the Decree with legal power, on organizing of MFA and DCM (Diplomatic and Consular Missions) of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia abroad from 10 August 1939, the Main archive was reorganized by becoming the History Department whose competence included:\r\n\r\n    arrangement, technical processing and keeping of old archives of all departments of the Ministry and diplomatic and consular missions and delegations for which it is necessary to be transferred to this department;\r\n    retrieving of all missing or lost papers referred to by the Law on archives of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and diplomatic and consular missions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia abroad.\r\n\r\nThe Library of the Ministry was part of the History Department, and was interrupted by the war for the period of almost four years. At that time, the Archive suffered irretrievable damage due to destruction of material and its transfer to Germany, and later to the USSR.\r\n\r\nThe History Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Federative Yugoslavia began to operate in March 1945. The needs of the new Ministry soon started to enlarge, and therefore the History Department was soon organized into three sections - Diplomatic Archive, Documentation and Library. The Diplomatic Archive soon became independent as a separate organization unit of the Ministry. From March 1945 until the middle of 1949, it mainly dealt with restitution of documents taken from our country in the course of the Second World War. Due to the external danger, to which Yugoslavia was exposed at the time, the Diplomatic Archive was closed again in 1949, and the documents transferred in the country's province. It started to operate by the end of 1957 in Dubrovnik, in the old building of the Benedictine monastery St. Jacob. In 1960 it was moved to Belgrade, and is since 1961, permanently open for scientific research.\r\nSince its foundation, the Diplomatic Archive had performed a conventional archival function, with the organization of work similar to archives of other Ministries in the world. It is a specialized archive necessary for the regular operation of the Ministry and other institutions of the country in charge of activities concerning foreign affairs, as well as scientific research.\r\n\r\nThe basic task of the Diplomatic Archive is systematic gathering, arranging and preservation of material resulted from the work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and diplomatic and consular missions, as well as the use of the material for scientific, cultural, educational, informative and operational needs.\r\n\r\nBy dividing of competence in 1981, the complete archive of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Serbia and its diplomatic and consular missions, from the period of 1854-1918, in total 128 files, was handed over to the Archive of Serbia.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of Article 46 of the Archive material of the Federation Law (Official Register of the SFRY No. 11, March 7 1986), the archive material of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and its diplomatic and consular missions for the period of 1918-1945, as well as the material which was not made by the Ministry, was handed over to the Archives of Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\nOut of all archive holdings of the Kingdom of Serbia and Kingdom of Montenegro, in other words, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Ministry (Foreign Legal Affairs Service) is only in possession of the Collection of international contracts, which, together with the contracts of the Republic of Yugoslavia, makes 9,840 files of bilateral contracts and 1,622 files of multilateral contracts (all computer processed).\r\n\r\nThe Diplomatic Archive today handles 132 holdings resulting from the work of the Ministry and its missions in the period from 1945. year till today, which consist of materials from bilateral and multilateral activity of our country. The information means - registers of material, books and guides to the archive material and depots - were also made.\r\n\r\nThe use of the archive material in the Diplomatic Archive is done on basis of the Regulations for use of archive material (Official Register of the SFRY No. 49, July 25 1987) and may be accessed for purposes of research or any other, after 30 years since its foundation. The archive also includes a reading room and information card catalog about the users.\r\n\r\nThe Diplomatic Archive has published the collections of public documents on foreign affairs of the SFRY from 07 March 1945-1950, by the name of Blue edition in eight volumes:\r\n\r\n    The Documents on foreign affairs of the SFRY from 1945, published by Yugoslav Survey, Belgrade, 1984;\r\n    The Documents on foreign affairs of the SFRY from 1946, both the volumes 1 and 2, Yugoslav Survey, Belgrade, 1985;\r\n    The Documents on foreign affairs of the SFRY from 1947, volume 1, Yugoslav Survey, Belgrade, 1985, and volume 2, Yugoslav Survey, Belgrade 1986;\r\n    The Documents on foreign affairs of the SFRY from 1948, Yugoslav Survey, Belgrade, 1989;\r\n    The Documents on foreign affairs of the SFRY from 1949, Yugoslav Survey, Belgrade 1991;\r\n    The Documents on foreign affairs of the SFRY from 1950, Yugoslav Survey, Belgrade, 1993.\r\n\r\nAs well as the collection of documents from the period of 1941-1945; documents on foreign affairs of the SFRY from 1941-1945, volume 1, Yugoslav Survey, Belgrade, 1988 and volume 2, Yugoslav Survey, Belgrade, 1989.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the FRY and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation have published a document code Relations between Yugoslavia and Russia (USSR) 1941-1945.\r\n\r\nThe Code was published by the Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Military Historic Institute and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, in Belgrade, 1996, in Serbian language.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation published, in 2010, a collection of documents entitled \"Yugoslav-Soviet Relations 1945-1956\", in Serbian and Russian."

The third department of the General Staff was given the task of “collecting data about the history of war, writing them up, arranging them and preserving them”, as well as to “manage the library and entire General Staff archive”. This History department within the General Staff was the predecessor of the current Military Archive. \r\n\r\nThe King’s regency regulation of March 6, 1940, transformed the History department into the Military History Institute. According to that regulation, the Institute was part of the General Staff and directly subordinate to it. History and War Experiment (Testing) Departments were established by the order of the Yugoslav People’s Liberation Army and the Partisans’ Supreme Commander on March 1, 1945, within the Yugoslav Army (YA) General Staff. Within the General Staff, there was also an Archival Department. In January 1946, the War Experiments Department was transformed into a separate unit, while the History Department was renamed the History Institute of the YA, and after April 1947, the Military Scientific and Publishing Institute. From Spring 1949 to Fall 2006, it was the Military History Institute, with the Military Archive as its part. \r\n\r\nFrom 1949 to 2006 there was the Vojnoistorijski institut (Military-historical Institute). Part of this Institute was Arhiv Vojnoistorijskog instituta, abbr. AVII (Archives of Military-historical Institute), a relevant institution for Holocaust. \r\n\r\nSince 2006 there are two independent institutions: Institut za strateška istraživanja, abbr. ISI (Institute for Strategic Research) and the Vojni arhiv, abbr,VA (Military Archives) which is relevant for the Holocaust. All the relevant archival collections are related to the Vojni arhiv and not to Arhiv Vojnoistorijskog instituta (Military-historical Institute).\r\n\r\nSo, since 2006 Vojni arhiv became an indipendent institution. \r\n\r\nSome of the documents, like the microfilm and conservation laboratory suffered severe damage during the 1999 bombing. However, most of the archives were transported and protected on time. "

Arhiva u Novom Sadu je dobila zadatak da prikuplja i obrađuje građu sa područja tadašnje Vojvodine – Banata, Bačke, Srema i Baranje. Arhive Bačko-bodroške, Torontalske i Tamiške županije, okruga, srezova, gradova, opština, pravosudnih institucija, prosvetnih ustanova, crkve i crkvenih organizacija, kao i mnoge privatne arhive – bile su prvo jezgro današnjeg Arhiva Vojvodine. Državna arhiva je imala sedište u zgradi Ženske učiteljske škole u Novom Sadu do 1934. kada je preseljena u Petrovaradin, u zgradu bivšeg Petrovaradinskog magistrata. Nakon aprilskog rata 1941. godine Državna arhiva se našla na teritoriji tzv. Nezavisne države Hrvatske. Veći deo arhivske građe nemačke vojne vlasti su prenele u Beč i Čehoslovačku, a deo građe je uništen prilikom preseljenja u neodgovarajuće prostorije Petrovaradinske tvrđave, gde se Arhiva nalazila od 1943. do 1945. godine. Preostala sačuvana arhivska građa je posle rata smeštena u suterenske prostorije Banovinske palate u Novom Sadu (tadašnje zgrade Glavnog narodnooslobodilačkog odbora Vojvodine, danas sedište Pokrajinske vlade AP Vojvodine). Godine 1946. Arhiva je nastavila sa radom pod novim imenom – Vojvođanska arhiva kada je rešenjem Personalnog otseka Glavnog izvršnog odbora Autonomne Pokrajine Vojvodine broj 2324 od 29. aprila 1946. za njenog upravnika postavljen Franja Malin. Odmah se pristupilo sređivanju građe koja se nalazila u izuzetno lošem stanju i pokrenut je i rad na restituciji arhivske građe, koja je odneta van zemlje tokom Drugog svetskog rata. Rešenjem Povereništva za prosvetu i kulturu GIONS-a broj 9649 od 15. 7. 1951. Vojvođanska arhiva je preimenovana u Državni arhiv Autonomne Pokrajine Vojvodine, a Izvršno veće Narodne skupštine AP Vojvodine donelo je 11. juna 1958. rešenje broj 7645 kojim se naziv menja u Istorijski arhiv Vojvodine. Arhiv je 1956. na osnovu ugovora o zakupu zaključenim između Državne arhive i Patrijaršije Srpske pravoslavne crkve na koji je saglasnost dalo Izvršno veće Narodne skupštine AP Vojvodine rešenjem broj 2694 od 21. 6. 1956. preseljen u Sremske Karlovce u zgradu Patrijaršijskog dvora i zgradu Fondova, a kasnije iz zgrade Fondova u zgradu bivšeg Karlovačkog magistrata. Godine 1968. Odlukom Izvršnog veća Autonomne Pokrajine Vojvodine broj 03-4601 od 27. decembra 1967. Arhivu je pripojen Poljoprivredni arhiv iz Novog Sada, osnovan 1962. kao specijalizovana arhivska ustanova za sređivanje i obradu arhivske građe iz oblasti poljoprivrede. Njegovim pripajanjem bile su iscrpljene mogućnosti za smeštaj arhivske građe i registraturskog materijala, tako da je jedan deo arhivskih fondova prenet u manastir Beočin. Sadašnji naziv, Arhiv Vojvodine, dobio je odlukom Skupštine Autonomne Pokrajine Vojvodine broj 08-828/1 od 27. 9. 1970. godine. Iste godine, postaje matični arhiv za sve arhive u Vojvodini i vrši stručni nadzor nad njihovim radom. Arhiv Vojvodine je 1988. preseljen u Novi Sad, u zgradu starog zatvora, adaptiranu za potrebe savremene arhivske službe, a arhivski fondovi iz konaka manastira Beočin su preneti 2000. godine. Nadležnost matičnog arhiva ukinuta Arhivu Vojvodine 1990, vraćena je Odlukom Skupštine AP Vojvodine 2003. godine. Od 2004. Arhiv Vojvodine ponovo vrši i stručni nadzor nad radom arhiva na teritoriji AP Vojvodine. Iste godine, počeo je da se razvija Informacioni sistem Arhiva Vojvodine.\r\n\r\nArhiv Vojvodine je za stručni, naučni i kulturni rad dobio više društvenih priznanja od kojih su najznačajniji: Orden zasluga za narod – nagrada Predsedništva SFRJ 1986. godine; Zlatna arhiva – nagrada Arhiva Srbije iz fonda Aleksandra Arnautovića, 1999. godine; Iskra kulture – nagrada Zavoda za kulturu Vojvodine, 2006. godine. Arhiv Vojvodine je ukazom predsednika Republike Srbije odlikovan Sretenjskim ordenom, drugog stepena, 2016. godine, za naročite zasluge u očuvanju kulturnog i istorijskog nasleđa, povodom 90 godina postojanja i uspešnog rada.\r\n"

There are also Ministerial archives, which are not subject to the authority of Rosarkhiv. Important examples include the Central Archive of the Russian Defence Ministry [Tsentralnyi arkhiv Ministerstva oborony RF, TsAMO] and the archives of the security services.

Preliminary contact with key Holocaust research and archival institutions in Russia has been established in order to facilitate future exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in the country. In order to identify the Russian archival institutions which store Holocaust-relevant resources, EHRI relied on expert knowledge readily available in EHRI’s partner institutions, such as Yad Vashem and the Warsaw-based Jewish Historical Institute [Żydowski Instytut Historyczny, ŻIH]. As a result, EHRI has identified over 50 archives which either certainly hold Holocaust-relevant material or can be expected to do so. While the full list can also be found in the extensive report, at least five central institutions should be named here:\r\n- the State Archives of the Russian Federation (GARF) in Moscow, which include the files of the Extraordinary State Committee to Investigate German Fascist Crimes Committed on Soviet Territory, the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee files as well as the Nuremberg Collection;\r\n- the Russian State Archives of Socio-Political History (RGASPI) in Moscow, which hold the files of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the General Headquarters of the Partisans in the Soviet Union with reports on the occupied areas. Based on the results of a joint survey of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Yad Vashem, EHRI has integrated several collection descriptions from RGASPI;\r\n- the Central Archives of the Russian Defence Ministry (TsAMO) in Podolsk, which hold reports from Red Army records (Main Political Administration of the Red Army, GLAVPUR) resembling those of the Partisan’s General HQ in RGASPI and store “trophy” (captured) documents mostly of German provenance;\r\n- the Russian State Military Archives [Rossiiskii gosudarstvennyi voennyi arkhiv, RGVA], which house a large number of similarly captured collections not only of German provenance, but also many related to the Jewish communities in France, Belgium, Greece, Austria etc.; and\r\n- an extensive collection of interviews with local citizens and Red Army servicemen conducted right after the liberation of territories of the Soviet Union is held by the Scientific Archive of the Russian History Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences\r\n\r\nRegional archives hold local files generated by the abovementioned Extraordinary Commission, as well as material from local occupation administrations such as administrative files, lists of persecuted or displaced citizens, propaganda newspapers etc. Most documents related to Holocaust can be found in two types of collections: in the fonds of the local Extraordinary Commission and in the fonds of the Partisan movement. The Extraordinary Commission Fonds is usually held by the central State archive, while the documents about partisan movement can be found in the former party archive. In the regional centers usually there are two archives: State archives and the former party archives.",

The selection of described collections was also based on the results of a joint survey of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Yad Vashem.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Russia’s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe senior authority in the archival system of Russia is the Federal Archival Agency [Rosarkhiv]. Only the federal archives are under its actual authority. In other words, only the archives situated in Moscow, such as State Archives of the Russian Federation (GARF), the Russian State Archives of Socio-Political History (RGASPI), and others. There are also ministerial archives, which are not subject to the authority of Rosarkhiv. Important examples include the Central Archive of the Russian Defence Ministry (TsAMO) and the archives of the security services. The Regional Archives are only partially subordinated to the Rosarkhiv as they largely depend on the local authorities.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Russia**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Russia**\r\n\r\nImportant Holocaust-related collections at the State Archives of the Russian Federation (GARF) include the files of the Extraordinary State Committee to Investigate German Fascist Crimes Committed on Soviet Territory, the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee files as well as the Nuremberg Collection. The Russian State Archives of Socio-Political History (RGASPI) most importantly holds the files of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the General Headquarters of the Partisans in the Soviet Union, which contain reports on the occupied areas. Similar reports from the Red Army Main Political Directorate (GLAVPUR) records can be found at the Central Archive of the Russian Defence Ministry (TsAMO), which also houses captured “trophy” documents mostly of German provenance. The Russian State Military Archive (RGVA) houses a large number of similarly captured collections. Regional archives hold local files generated by the abovementioned Extraordinary Commission as well as material from local occupation administrations.\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified over 50 archival institutions which hold or are likely to hold Holocaust-relevant material in Russia. A dozen of them are concentrated in Moscow. Three more are located in cities near Moscow: Podolsk, Domodedovo and Krasnogorsk. A smaller cluster of relevant archival institutions is located in or near St. Petersburg. EHRI has also found that 14 other cities of the Russian Federation, mostly regional capitals or capitals of autonomous member-republics, have one State Archive and one Contemporary History Archive, which stems back to a former Communist Party Archive. EHRI has managed to provide collections descriptions for a number of these archives, which are located in Belgorod, Kaliningrad, Kaluga, Krasnodar, Kursk, Nalchik, Pskov, Rostov, Smolensk, Stavropol, Tula, Tver, Volgograd, Voronezh. EHRI has also identified and, in some cases, described collections in archival institutions in the following cities: Bryansk, Birobidzhan, Cherkessk, Elista, Maykop, Novgorod, Orel, Penza, Taganrog, Ust-Labinsk, Yeysk.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Russia, EHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections that are relevant to Holocaust research on Russia. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, for instance, holds selected records from a number of Russian Federation archives, both capital and regional. In Israel, Yad Vashem also holds significant documentation from archives in Russia and a huge quantity of sources pertaining to Jewish individuals and/or groups during the Holocaust period.\r\n",

It was under the jurisdiction of the secretariat of the Adygea Regional Executive Committee, at the same time subordinated to the Central Archive of the RSFSR and the Kuban-Black Sea Archival Bureau, subsequently to the Archival Administration of the North Caucasus Territory, from 1934 to the Azov-Black Sea Territory, and from 1937 to the Krasnodar Kray. The archive materials are divided according to the time of their occurrence into 2 periods - pre-revolutionary (pre-Soviet) and post-revolutionary (Soviet). In 1942, the archive temporarily ceased its activities because of the Nazy occupation of the territory of the Adygei Autonomous Region (1942-1943). Archive funds were partially lost during the evacuation to Central Asia, partially destroyed on the spot during the occupation. The saved documents were returned together with the documents of the Krasnodar Regional Archive in 1945.\r\nIn accordance with the decree of the President of the RSFSR of August 24, 1991 “On Party Archives”, the party archive of the Adygea Regional Party Committee of the CPSU is incorporated into the system of the State Archive of the Republic of Adygea as a repository of recent history documentation. In 1992, the Office for Archives of the Republic of Adygea was created. In 2011, the Archive got the prasent name the State Institution of the Republic of Adygea “National Archive”."

From 1924 to 1953 there were changes in the administrative-territorial division in the territory of the modern Yeisk district.\r\nDuring the Great Patriotic War, the documents of the Yeisk archive, together with the building of the Yeisk executive committee, were destroyed by the retreating units of the Red Army. From August 1942 to February 1943, Yeisk was occupied by the German fascist invaders, the documents deposited during this period were transferred to the State Archives of the Krasnodar Territory (GAKK). From April 20, 1943, the Yeisk Archival Service resumed its activities.\r\nBy the decree of the head of the administration of the city of Yeisk of 02.04.1993 No. 942, an archive of documents on personnel was created as an independent institution.\r\nIn 1994, the state archive of the city was transformed into the archive department of the administration of the city of Yeisk, with the maintenance of archives of institutions, organizations and enterprises of the Yeisk district. Practically throughout the history, the archive of the city of Yeisk was a unified archive, with the authority to store archival documents of the Yeisk region."

Between the years 1928 and 1938 archive resource of the province rose ten times. \r\n\r\nIn 1934 following administration reform of the Soviet state both archives were unifed as the State Archive of the Kursk Oblast. \r\n\r\nFollowing German invasion on Soviet Union, in July 1941 most valuable documents from the Kursk Oblast were transfered to Ufa (Bashkiria Autonomous Republic) and Uralsk (Kazakhstan). Many other documents, almost all from the period of 1930-1942 perished during the war. \r\n\r\nKursk Oblast Archive resumed its activity in 1943. Full reevacuation of the documents was finished in 1946. New documentation of the archival resources discovered loss of many valuable books, photographic material and 275 record groups referring to the years 1921-1938.\r\n\r\nDue to the lack of space and facilities the archive resumed receiving new documents only in 1957. It continues its work until today. \r\n"

All the film and photo production was concentrated in the IV department of the State Archive of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic and then transferred to the Central Archive of the October Revolution. From 1926 Archive started to receive cinema production of Sovkino, Proletkino, and various other institutions, as well as films stored in the other archives. In the years 1927 and 1928 for the purpose of storage of those films Central Archive of the October Revolution created special space. In 1934 this branch of the October Revolution Archive became Central Photo and Cinema Archive. \r\n\r\nIn 1953 the archive was transferred into its current location. In 1967 the archive was divided into two separate institutions: Central State Archive of Voice Recordings of USSR and Central State Archive of Cinema and Photographic Documents of USSR. "

During the first years, the association had museum-like activities in several different premises in Lund.\r\n\r\nIn 1890, the property now known as Herrehuset, with a large residential building, pond, garden and gazebo, was purchased. The house was given a new baroque façade and a number of other buildings were moved to the area. Four of these were to tell the story of the old parliamentary system divided into nobility, clergy, burghers and peasants. In 1892, Kulturen i Lund was inaugurated as Sweden's and the world's second open-air museum. The buildings displayed the collections organised according to different themes.\r\n\r\nOver the next few years, the neighbouring properties were purchased. The city centre was built up in stages between 1907 and 1930. In the more than thirty cultural history buildings, exhibitions on cultural history, crafts, art and design are displayed. "

For these institutions, EHRI has made over 150 top-level relevant archival descriptions available.
