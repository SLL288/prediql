In March 1945, Argentina declared war on Japan and its ally Germany, just before their capitulation.\r\n\r\nBetween 1918 and 1933, 79,000 Jews migrated to Argentina thanks to its relaxed immigration policies. However, rising numbers of Jewish refugees contributed to the tightening of immigration laws in 1938. Shortly before the start of the Second World War, the Argentinian government sent a secret circular to its consuls in Europe ordering them to deny visas to Jewish applicants. The impact was significant; between 1933 and 1943, only 24,000 Jewish refugees were officially admitted into the country, while 20,000 Jews entered Argentina illegally. According to the census of 1947, there was a Jewish population of 249,330 out of a total population of 15,893,827. \r\n\r\nArgentina had and has a small Roma population.

              "history": "Austria was occupied and annexed by the German Reich in March 1938. Many Austrians welcomed this \u201cAnschluss\u201d, after which they were treated as Germans. On April 10, 1938, the \u201cAct on the Reunification of Austria with the German Reich\u201d was recognized by a referendum. Austria was integrated into the general administration of the German Reich and subdivided into seven Reichsgaue in 1939. In 1945, the Red Army took Vienna and eastern parts of the country, while the Western Allies occupied the western and southern sections.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Austria had a total population of about 6,753,000 people. After the \u201cAnschluss\u201d [annexation], 206,000 of them, including refugees from Germany, were persecuted as Jews under the Nuremberg Laws. The Austrian Nazi Party, which had been outlawed before the \u201cAnschluss\u201d, however, did not target only the Jews, but also other ethnic, social and political groups, such as the Roma, their political opponents, the disabled, \u201canti-social elements\u201d, and others. In the process, Austrians became involved in all types of Nazi crimes. In the first days and weeks of Nazi rule, Jews were subjected to brutal outbreaks of violence, including theft and murder. Subsequently, most Jews in the provinces were forced to move to Vienna or abroad. The \u201cZentralstelle f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Auswanderung in Wien\u201d (\u201cCentral Office for Jewish Emigration in Vienna\u201d), founded by the SS in August 1938, not only served as a model for the organisation of the expulsions, but also for the mass deportations from October 1939 onwards. Similar institutions were founded in Berlin, Prague, and Amsterdam. After the November pogroms in 1938, about 6,500 mostly male Jews from Austria were imprisoned, and 4,000 among them were sent to the Dachau concentration camp. By the beginning of the war in September 1939 about 130,000 Jews fled from Austria. During the war, the remaining Jews in Austria were subjected to ever increasing isolation by new regulations, including forced transferal to smaller quarters and the introduction of the obligatory Jewish Star in 1941. Austrian Jews were deported to ghettos, concentration and extermination camps, among others to Nisko, Kielce, Opole, Theresienstadt/Terez\u00edn, Litzmannstadt/\u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Riga, Maly Trostinez/Maly Trascianiec and Auschwitz-Birkenau. In May / June 1944, Jewish prisoners, mostly from Hungary, were moved to camps in Austria, particularly to the Mauthausen concentration camp complex and forced labour camps along the Eastern border. Especially in March and April 1945 thousands of them died on death marches. Overall, around 66,000 Austrian Jews perished in the Holocaust. \r\n\r\nThere were about 11,000 Roma living in Austria before the war. They were subject to harsh racist campaigns throughout the first decades of the 1900s. Shortly after the \u201cAnschluss\u201d in March 1938, Roma and Sinti were deprived of their rights as citizens and several hundred were deported to concentration camps. Since 1939, many detention camps (so-called \u201cZigeunerlager\u201d [\u201cGypsy Camps\u201d]) were erected in several places all over Austria. The largest camp was Lackenbach, which held around 4,000 Roma from the Burgenland. In November 1941, 5007 Austrian Roma were deported to the ghetto in Litzmannstadt. No one survived: They died in the ghetto or were murdered in Kulmhof. Since March 1943, Sinti and Roma were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Of the estimated 11,000 pre-war Roma, Sinti and Lovara population who were Austrian citizens in 1938, only 1,500 to 2,000 survived. ",

When the Nazis took power in Germany in 1933, many German Jews migrated to Australia. The Australian government was initially hesitant in permitting entry to many Jews, but in 1938, it allotted 15,000 visas to \u201cvictims of oppression\u201d. Some 7,000 Jews were able to obtain these visas before the outbreak of the Second World War put an end to the program. Jews from Germany were interned as enemy aliens from the start of the war until 1942. In the aftermath of the Second World War, Australia gradually abandoned its previous Anglo-centric immigration policy and permitted immigration of some European Jews who were survivors of the Holocaust. In 1939, Australia had a population of 6,935,000.\r\n\r\nFor this country there are no sufficient findings on the history of Roma during the Second World War.

              "history": "Annexed by Austria-Hungary in 1908, Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of Yugoslavia between the world wars. In April 1941, when Germany\u2019s twelve-day campaign against Yugoslavia led to its partition between the Axis powers and their allies, Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of the Independent State of Croatia [Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska, NDH], founded on 10 April 1941. While the Usta\u0161e movement and its leader (Poglavnik), Ante Paveli\u0107, assumed authority, the new state depended on German and Italian support. The Independent State of Croatia effectively ceased to exist in May 1945. Bosnia and Herzegovina became one of the six republics within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It declared independence in 1992.\r\n\r\nBefore the Second World War, Bosnia and Herzegovina had a total population of 2.5 million inhabitants. Of this population, about 14,500 were Jews spread throughout some 20 Jewish communities. Between 1933 and 1940, this number greatly increased as some 55,000 Jews from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia fled through the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Only 4,000 of these Jews remained in April 1941. The Usta\u0161e movement implemented a policy of discrimination, expropriation and mass murder against Serbs, Roma, communists, and Jews. The Independent State of Croatia established a number of camps. In 1941, deportation of Jews began to concentration camps in Gospi\u0107, Jadovno, Jasenovac, Stara Gradi\u0161ka, \u0110akovo, Loborgrad and others, and in 1942, to Auschwitz. Concentration camps claimed the lives of almost 80 % of Jews from Bosnia and Herzegovina. About 10,000 members of the pre-war Bosnian Jewish population had been murdered by 1945.\r\n\r\nAt least around 4,000 Roma lived on the eve of the Second World War in the territories of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina. The pro-fascist Ustasha movement led a genocidal policy towards the Roma in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Part of the Muslim intellectual and religious community claimed that 'White Gypsies' (Muslim sedentary Roma) must be considered as an integral part of the Muslim community ('Aryans') and therefore be spared from persecution. Such views and demands were published in May 1942 in the 'Zenica Resolution' which was accepted by the Ustasha authorities. A significant part of the rest of the Roma community was persecuted mostly through deportation to camps (especially the Jasenovac camp), where they were tortured and killed. Some Roma joined the anti-fascist partisan resistance movement. Despite some Muslim Roma being rescued during the war, the Roma community was still devastated. In the census of 1948, there were only 442 Roma identified.",
              "summary": "In Bosnia and Herzegovina, EHRI has identified a helpful guide which contains general information about Bosnian archives:\r\n\r\n- Bakar\u0161ic\u0301, Kemal, *Fragmenti kulturne historije Bosne i Hercegovine* (Sarajevo: Magistrat, 2005)\r\n\r\nSeveral archival institutions in the country have guides offering details about their collections but they are rarely available in English. More importantly, EHRI has identified several repositories relevant for Holocaust research, and described over 60 collections in this country. The Archives of Bosnia-Herzegovina can be considered the most important institution to hold Holocaust-relevant material in the country, as they have a vast collection from the Second World War period and from the Research Commission of Crimes Committed by Occupying Forces. Furthermore, the Jewish Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina [Muzej Jevreja Bosne i Hercegovine], which is a branch of the Museum of Sarajevo [Muzej Sarajevo], and the Historical Archives Sarajevo [Historijski arhiv Sarajevo] have documents concerning the Holocaust. Other archives and institutions in the country which are likely to be relevant for Holocaust research are the Jewish Community of Sarajevo, the Tuzla County Archives [Arhiv Tuzlanskog kantona] and Archives of Republika Srpska, among others.\r\n\r\nOutside of Bosnia and Herzegovina, certain Croatian archives, such as the Croatian State Archive in Zagreb and Osijek, may have further relevant material. In Serbia, the Jewish Historical Museum [Jevrejski istorijski muzej] in Belgrade holds significant amount of material pertaining to the Holocaust period in Bosnia. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) offers a number of relevant oral history interviews, and repositories in Germany and Italy are very likely to have collections pertaining to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\n"

              "history": "Belgium was invaded by German forces on 10 May 1940 and surrendered on 28 May under the orders of King Leopold III. The King stayed in Belgium, but the Prime Minister and many cabinet members fled to London, where they set up a government-in-exile. The German occupiers formed a military administration (for Belgium and Northern France), led by Alexander von Falkenhausen, which was replaced by a civilian administration in July 1944. Belgium was liberated in September of that year, although the fighting and bombing continued in parts of the country until May 1945.\r\n\r\nDuring the occupation, German orders resulted in the registration of about 57,000 Jews in Belgium, out of a total Belgian population of over 8 million. Of those Jews, 10 percent at the most were Belgian citizens; the others were mostly recent immigrants from Eastern and Central Europe. Over 90 percent of the Jewish population resided in Brussels and Antwerp. Shortly after the German invasion, the Belgian government arrested a few thousand German (and Austrian) nationals, including Jews, and sent them to camps in France. The Jews among them were later included in the deportations from France. Anti-Jewish legislation was first enacted in October 1940, while the economic plundering of the Jews began in May 1941. In April 1941, a pogrom took place in Antwerp, organized by local anti-Jewish organizations. In May 1942, the Yellow Star became obligatory. Then, in July 1942, Jews were summoned to the Dossin barracks [\"Sammellager Mechelen/Malines\"], a new transit camp in Mechelen (a city between Antwerp and Brussels) through an \u201cArbeitseinsatzbefehl\u201d [\u201cwork order\u201d]. In the summer of 1942, the German police forces and their collaborators actively started looking for Jews, with large raids taking place in Brussels and Antwerp. The deportations began on 4 August 1942 and lasted until 31 July 1944. A total of 28 convoys left the Dossin camp, mainly for Auschwitz, four convoys left for other camps: one to Ravensbr\u00fcck-Buchenwald and Bergen-Belsen, and two to Vittel. Overall, 25,490 Jews arrested in Belgium and northern France were deported from Mechelen. The vast majority perished in the camps, approximately 1,700 survived.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War, a few hundred Sinti and Roma lived in Belgium. The Belgian\u2019s Aliens Police particularly targeted Roma and Sinti in its activities to take action against those who were considered a threat to national security or public morals. On 21 December 1941 the Belgian Aliens Police introduced the so-called \u201cCarte de Nomade / Zigeunerkaart\u201d [\u201cGypsy Card\u201d], a new identification card exclusively for Sinti and Roma. These temporary residence permits had to be renewed every three months and later served to track people down in raids and for deportations, which started in 1943. 352 Sinti and Roma, arrested in Belgium and Northern France were deported from the Dossin barracks [\"Sammellager Mechelen/Malines\"] on 15 January 1944 to Auschwitz-Birkenau. 10 individuals were deported there separately. 34 of them survived.",
              "summary": "EHRI has identified a number of helpful publications and archival guides on Belgium (see the extensive report). At the same time as EHRI had started its identification and investigation work, the National Archives of Belgium commenced a project which aimed to produce a guide to sources on Jewish life in Belgium. EHRI closely cooperated with this project\u2019s directors and researchers. The identification of repositories holding Holocaust-related collections dramatically improved thanks to this collaborative identification work. \r\n\r\nOne of the most important Belgian archives for Holocaust research is Kazerne Dossin: Memorial, Museum and Research Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights. This museum and research centre actively collects material, often private collections, about the Holocaust in Belgium. It holds the largest collection of materials on the topic in Belgium, including original, photocopied and scanned materials. EHRI supported Kazerne Dossin by helping them transfer the existing texts into archival descriptions according to international archival standards and integrating new descriptions into this system. This resulted in a major step forward for Kazerne Dossin: from 17 collection descriptions, Kazerne Dossin now provides EHRI with hundreds of descriptions. It is continuing this effort in order to make all its materials publicly available on a collection level.\r\n\r\nMade up of the National Archives, 17 State Archives in the Provinces, the Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (CEGESOMA); and the Directorate-General for War Victims, the State Archives are another significant institution that hold Holocaust-related material. In particular, the National Archives branch in Brussels conserve the archive of the former Military Justice system, which includes all the post-war trial records. Some important city (and communal) archives also have Holocaust-related material, such as those of Brussels, Antwerp, Li\u00e8ge, Charleroi and Ghent. Moreover, EHRI has worked closely CEGESOMA. Collection descriptions from the Centre were selected via key-word selection and literature search (verification of bibliographies of key works on the Holocaust in Belgium) and integrated onto the Portal by EHRI. This export includes archival documents, manuscripts, interview descriptions, and photo descriptions. As for the Directorate-General for War Victims, it possesses one of the largest and most important collections on the Holocaust in Belgium from the victims\u2019 perspective.\r\n\r\nThere are also several important private archival institutions in Belgium. Notably, the Jewish Museum of Belgium in Brussels, which holds important sources related to the victims, as do some remembrance organisations, such as the Auschwitz Foundation and the Foundation of Contemporary Memory, which collect testimonies.\r\n\r\nMany other sources are stored in repositories outside of Belgium. First of all, there are the archives of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (with branches in New York and Jerusalem) and the World Jewish Congress records on Belgium (stored at the Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati). The Yad Vashem archives hold both original and copied materials on Jews in Belgium, including the original documents of the Belgian Jewish Committee in London during the Second World War. Likewise, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum holds vast materials on Jews in Belgium, both originals and copies. Their copy collection on Belgium includes copies from Kazerne Dossin, the Directorate-General for War Victims, CEGESOMA, and the National Archives (Foreigners\u2019 Police archives, Br\u00fcsseler Treuhandgesellschaft collection, Archive of the Diamond collection and other files). The USHMM\u2019s original collections include the \u201cFela and Chai\u0308m Perelman papers\u201d. The extensive report on Belgium also includes references to publications on sources on Belgium stored in German and French archives (most notably, the German sources on Belgium kept at the French National Archives at Pierrefitte-sur-Seine, the sub-series AJ40, and those kept at the Bundesarchiv-Milit\u00e4rarchiv Freiburg)."

              "history": "Bulgaria joined the Axis alliance in March 1941 and entered the Second World War following Germany\u2019s campaign against Yugoslavia and Greece in April 1941. Territories in both occupied countries came under Bulgarian military and civilian administration. Bulgaria\u2019s involvement in the wars of the Axis, however, did not go any further. Bulgaria did not join Hitler\u2019s war against the Soviet Union; it did not sever diplomatic ties with the Soviets. In August 1944, Bulgaria began to distance itself from the Axis. The government declared war on Germany on 8 September 1944, only to be overthrown by a communist coup one day later as the Red Army entered Bulgarian territory.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Second World War, Bulgaria had 6,341,000 inhabitants. Among them were some 48,000 Jews, most of whom lived in the capital Sofia. In January 1941, the pro-Nazi government, despite public opposition, introduced the antisemitic \u201cLaw for the Protection of the Nation\u201d which put numerous restrictions on the country\u2019s Jews. It was implemented by the specially created Commissariat for Jewish Affairs [Komisarstvo po Evreyskite Vuprosi, KEV]. After 1941, all Jewish men between 20 and 45 years of age were drafted for forced labour and mainly put to work building roads and railways. In February 1943, the head of the KEV, Alexander Belev, and the German SS-Plenipotentiary Theodor Dannecker signed an agreement for the deportation of 20,000 Jews from Bulgaria\u2019s \u201cnew territories\u201d, in Macedonia and Thrace. Since there were not enough Jews in these areas (slightly above 11,000) to reach this figure, the rest were to be taken from a number of towns in Bulgaria. 11,343 Macedonian and Thracian Jews were deported by Bulgarian and German authorities to Treblinka and murdered there in March 1943, but no Jews from Bulgaria proper. The Bulgarian government resumed planning to meet the German demands for the deportation of Jews from Bulgaria in May 1943 (which met with public protest). The Bulgarian Jews, except those who lived abroad under German occupation and were denied Bulgarian help, survived despite the hardship of the war years. Anti-Jewish laws were formally repealed in late August 1944. At the end of the war, 49,172 Jews lived within the old boundaries of Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nAccording to a 1934 census, there were 149,385 Roma living mostly in villages in Bulgaria. Roma communities were subject to discrimination, forced labour, and restricted movement. Roma living in Bulgarian occupied territories were subject to various kinds of persecution\r\n",

Other Central and Regional Archives also hold Holocaust-related documents. These are Military Archive in Veliko Tarnovo and also the regional branches of the Central State Archive. Outside of Bulgaria, relevant material from the Holocaust-period can be found in a number of institutions. EHRI was able to identify, among other institutions, the German Bundesarchiv in Berlin Lichterfelde and in Freiburg, the Politisches Archiv des Ausw\u00e4rtigen Amtes, and Yad Vashem in Israel.

              "history": "The territory of what is present-day Belarus was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793. In January 1919, the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed. After the Polish-Soviet War of 1920, the western regions of Belarus, including the cities of Brest, Hrodna, Nowogr\u00f3dek (Navahrudak) and Pinsk, were incorporated into Poland, while the east remained part of the Soviet Union. Following the Ribbentrop-Molotov Agreement, the Red Army occupied eastern Poland in September 1939 and reclaimed previously lost territory. When German armies crossed the Soviet border on 22 June 1941, they seized the capital of the Belarusian Soviet Republic, Minsk, within a week. By September 1941, Germany controlled all of Belarus. The western part of the occupied Soviet Republic came under a civilian administration, while the east was administered by the military. The territory under civilian administration was divided between the White Ruthenia General District (the main portion of the territory) and the Lithuania General District (the north-western part), both subordinate to Reichskommissariat Ostland. Other areas were attached to Reichskommissariat Ukraine (in the South) and the Bia\u0142ystok District, which was attached to the German Gau East Prussia (in the North-West). The Red Army ended the German occupation of Belarus in August 1944. Belarus declared independence from the USSR in August 1991.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the German invasion, the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic had an estimated total population of 9,200,000 people. About 700,000 of them were Jews. According to various estimates, between 153,000 and 165,000 Jews from Belarus managed to flee or were evacuated when Germany invaded. The main perpetrators of the murder campaign were members of Einsatzgruppen A and B and the Security and Order Police stationed in Belarus. Most of the Jews in Belarus were exterminated in two major waves: between the late summer and winter of 1941 and during 1942. As the scope of mass murder widened, the Germans increasingly relied on local collaborators and collaborating organizations. The last Jewish ghettos in Western Belarus were liquidated in the summer of 1942, while the Minsk Ghetto, one of the largest in Europe, was fully liquidated by October 1943. The percentage of Jews who perished in Belarus during the Holocaust is among the highest in Europe. The number of victims has been estimated to be at least 450,000 and may be in the range of 600,000, including Jewish refugees from Poland. In Belarus, the Germans not only murdered Jews living in the country, but also Jews from the Reich or Bohemia who were deported or escaped to Belarus from all over Europe.\r\n\r\nRoma have had a presence in what is today Belarus since the 15th century. According to a Soviet census conducted in 1939, there were 3,362 Roma living in the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (BSSR). The actual number was higher because the western parts of Belarus belonged to Poland at the time (and no census data exists for this area) and some Roma were registered as Belarusians or Russians. Little is known about the history of Roma living in the western parts of Belarus under Soviet rule between September 1939 and June 1941. Under German occupation, Roma communities were subject to displacement, forced labour, and concentration. Most were killed on the spot in summary executions and mass shootings by both German soldiers and local collaborators. It is estimated that at least 3,000 Belorussian Roma were killed.",
              "summary": "EHRI has identified a number of helpful archival guides on Belarus, some of which are available online. A list is provided in the EHRI extensive report on Belarus. EHRI established contact with central Belarusian archival authorities to facilitate future exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in the country.\r\n\r\nThe most important Belarusian archives for Holocaust research include the National Archives of the Republic of Belarus. Their collections cover German occupation organizations, Communist Party and Partisan organization files as well as the post-Liberation investigations of the Belarusian Extraordinary State Committee to Investigate German Fascist Crimes Committed on Soviet Territory. Similar files of a more local provenance are contained in the Regional Archives in Viciebsk, Mahilio\u016d, Homiel, Hrodna and, most importantly, Brest, where larger collections containing material of Jewish origin also exist.

Under the leadership of Liberal Prime Minister William Mackenzie King, the federal government set up highly restrictive and ethnically selective immigration policy. For the period 1933-1945, between 5,000 and 10,000 Jewish migrants were accepted into the country, many of whom arrived before the war started. During the war, the arrivals were very limited; some 2,000 German and Austrian Jewish \u201cenemy aliens\u201d were transported from Great Britain and interned in Canada, and 400 refugees came from Spain and Portugal in 1944. Conversely, after the war, Holocaust survivors became one of the immediate post-war era\u2019s largest migrant categories: From 1947 to 1955, 35,000 of them resettled in Canada. \r\n\r\nFor this country there are no sufficient findings on the history of Roma during the Second World War.

The Parliament elected a war-time commander-in-chief of the army who, along with the Federal Council, issued joint orders to resist any invader in April 1940. German plans to outflank the French through Swiss territory were dismissed. While Switzerland enjoyed the double advantage of being a secondary objective for the Axis powers and of being able to deter attackers thanks to difficult terrain and quite a formidable military force, the country found itself effectively surrounded by Axis territory after the fall of France. The last remaining exit was closed off after the German occupation of Vichy France in November 1942. Switzerland maintained armed neutrality throughout the Second World War.\r\n\r\nBefore the war, Switzerland had a total population of about 4,066,400 people. Some 19,000 of them were Jews (half Swiss, half foreign-born). While Switzerland provided asylum to political refugees from Germany after 1933, Swiss authorities did not consider \u201cracial\u201d persecution a valid reason for asylum. While some 30,000 Jewish refugees who reached Switzerland during the war were admitted, approximately the same number was turned back at the border. At the end of the war, as part of efforts to aid concentration camp prisoners, Switzerland accepted transports of Jewish prisoners from various camps, including Bergen-Belsen, Theresienstadt and Buchenwald.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland imposed several anti-Roma policies prior to the First World War such as prohibiting Sinti and Roma from traveling by rail or boat, a ban on entering the country, and identification through an official registry. During the Second World War, refugees of the minority were returned to Nazi Germany or imprisoned while awaiting expulsion. Those who were already Swiss residents faced forced sterilization and abortions. The 1906 ban on Romani people entering Switzerland was lifted in 1972.",

              "history": "The Bohemian lands (Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia) were part of the Habsburg monarchy until the First World War, and of the First Czechoslovak Republic between 1918 and 1938. Following the signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938, the border territories along the nowadays German and Austrian frontier were annexed by Germany (and a small part of Silesia by Poland). Most of these areas were reorganized as the Reichsgau Sudetenland, while areas in the West and South were attached to neighboring German Gaue. Further territorial losses between September and November 1938, led to the federalisation of Czechoslovakia (Czecho-Slovakia). In March 1939 Nazi Germany occupied the rest of the Bohemian lands, creating the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, with its own government and administration under close German supervision. The German-occupied Protectorate functioned up to the end of the war in May 1945.\r\n\r\nIn 1939, the Bohemian lands had a total population of about 11 million inhabitants (10,674,386 according to the 1930 census). After the Munich Agreement, most of the approximately 25,000 Jews from Sudetenland escaped or were expelled into the interior of the country. In the Protectorate, the occupiers regarded some 118,000 inhabitants as Jews. This Jewish community had modernized and had largely assimilated with German and Czech society in the Bohemian lands. In the context of rising nationalism and antisemitism, the first exclusionary measures were already taken during the Second Republic (1938-39). After the occupation, the Germans, as well as the semi-autonomous authorities of the Protectorate, imposed laws and various ordinances to discriminate against Jews and confiscate their property. In autumn 1939, some 5,000 Jews were deported from Vienna and Ostrava to Nisko. Before further emigration was banned in 1941, 26,000 Jews emigrated legally and several more illegally from the Protectorate. In 1941-42 several thousand Jews were deported to the ghettos of Litzmannstadt, Riga and Minsk, where they shared the history of the local Jewish population. In November 1941 the Theresienstadt [Terez\u00edn] ghetto was created; over 80,000 Jews from the Bohemian lands, but also more than 60,000 from Germany, Austria, and other Nazi-controlled territories were deported there between 1942 and 1945. Theresienstadt became a transit ghetto, because most of the prisoners were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau and other extermination camps. About 33,000 Theresienstadt (mostly elderly) inmates perished in the ghetto due to the harsh conditions. In 1943-44, approximately 17,500 prisoners were deported to the Theresienstadt Family Camp in Auschwitz-Birkenau which was probably created for propaganda purposes. Most of the prisoners were killed in two large actions. At the end of the war there were 2,800 Jews in the Bohemian lands (most of them from \u201cmixed\u201d families), but the number of survivors was larger (about 14,000, together with the surviving deportees). Altogether, about 80,000 Czech Jews perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nDuring the interwar period, approximately 70\u2013100,000 Roma lived in the territories of the whole Czechoslovak Republic. The vast majority lived in Slovakia. After the Anschluss in 1938, anti-Roma sentiment radicalized, and the population faced increasing discrimination. After the establishment of the Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia in 1939, legislation and praxis towards Roma and Sinti was adjusted to the regulations already valid in Germany. Around 6,500 Roma were racially categorised by official authorities, many were deported into the detention camps Lety near Pisek and Hodonin near Kunstadt and later deported to Auschwitz.

              "history": "Adolf Hitler was appointed Reich Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Within half a year, his National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party succeeded in establishing a one-party dictatorship. Political enemies of the Nazis were taken into \u201cprotective custody\u201d and held in concentration camps under emergency regulations. After the death of Reich President Paul von Hindenburg in 1934, Hitler declared himself head of state. As of 1938, the German Reich expanded by force, annexing Austria and the Czech Sudetenland. It seized the remaining Czech lands in March 1939. In September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, thus provoking declarations of war by Poland\u2019s allies Great Britain and France. During the ensuing Second World War, German troops occupied much of continental Europe. Throughout the areas under German control and in territories controlled by its allies, apparent and actual resisters, as well as \u201cracial\u201d undesirables, were persecuted and murdered. Most German territory was occupied by the Allies by the spring of 1945. The German army unconditionally surrendered to the Allies in May 1945.\r\n\r\nIn early 1933, the German Reich had a total population of over 65 million inhabitants. About 552,000 of them were adherents of the Jewish faith. Many of them opted for emigration when they were threatened by Hitler\u2019s rise to power. As antisemitism was a cornerstone of his Nazi Party\u2019s ideology, it was quickly put into practice. Supported by a prevalent antisemitic sentiment in Germany, the Nazis propagated their pseudo-scientific \u201cracial\u201d anti-Jewish beliefs, managing to exclude German Jews both socially and economically: According to the May 1939 census, which applied \u201cracial\u201d criteria, there remained approximately 242,000 so-called \u201cfull Jews\u201d, some 20,000 of whom were not adherents of the Jewish faith. The Nazis considered 85,000 other people as \u201chalf-Jews\u201d and \u201cquarter-Jews\u201d, in other words, people with a certain degree of Jewish descent.\r\n\r\nIn April 1933, a Reich-wide boycott of Jewish businesses was implemented and all Jews were dismissed from state employment. In 1935, the racist Nuremberg Laws forbade marital and sexual relations between Germans of non-Jewish descent and those of Jewish descent, unless they were already married. Jewish businesses and properties were subject to \u201cAryanisation\u201d, which amounted to full-scale expropriation of the Jews in Germany. After leaving behind most of their possessions, many of those who successfully emigrated from Germany during the 1930s settled in European countries which were later affected by the Holocaust. During a Reich-wide pogrom in November 1938, practically all synagogues in Germany were systematically attacked and destroyed, Jewish shops and homes looted, hundreds killed and some 30,000 Jewish men taken to concentration camps. German antisemitic ideology and propaganda increasingly affected Germany\u2019s allies and spread to all occupied areas.\r\n\r\nAfter the start of the war, the remaining 214,000 Jews in Germany were almost completely isolated, suffered from radically reduced rations and soon had to move to special \u201cJewish houses\u201d. They were now obliged to join the Reich Association of Jews in Germany [\u201cReichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland\u201d], which was overseen by the Gestapo; many Jews were subjected to forced labor and the first attempts at mass deportations were made in 1939/40. In autumn 1941 the obligatory \u201cJewish Star\u201d was introduced and the few remaining possibilities of emigration were shut off. For all but a small minority of Jews, mostly those protected by so-called \u201cmixed\u201d marriages, the deportations \u201cto the East\u201d began. There, they were either murdered upon arrival or temporarily left in impossible living conditions. Ultimately, those who survived were sent on to extermination camps. Very few of the deportees survived the war. Most early deportations went to the Reichskommissariat Ostland, the Litzmannstadt Ghetto or camps and ghettos in the General Government in occupied Poland; later deportations were mostly directed to the Theresienstadt Ghetto or went straight to Auschwitz. As of mid-1943, the Reich was declared \u201cfree of Jews\u201d; the remaining 20,000 Jews, most of them in \u201cmixed marriages\u201d or of \u201cmixed race\u201d, were completely excised from German law and entirely subject to the Gestapo. Only very few were able to go into hiding. Beginning in mid-1944, up to 200,000 Jewish forced laborers, mostly of east-central European descent, were brought from camps and ghettos outside the Reich to concentration camps inside Germany. As the Allies approached the Reich, members of the large Jewish prisoners\u2019 group in particular were forced on so-called death marches and many died. Overall, about 130,000 Jews deported from Germany (and 35,000 German Jews deported from other countries) perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nThe approximately 20,000 Sinti and Roma (1933) were also excluded from the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" as a \"foreign race\" in accordance with the Nuremberg Laws. The first mass deportations to concentration camps began in the summer of 1938, and a systematic total registration of the entire minority started in the fall of 1938, which was implemented by the criminal police in close cooperation with the Racial Hygiene Research Unit in Berlin. In May 1940, the first family by family deportation of around 2,500 Sinti and Roma to German-occupied Poland took place, and in December 1942, Heinrich Himmler ordered the transfer of all Sinti and Roma to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration and extermination camp. Around 15,000 German Sinti and Roma were murdered, and around 2,000 Sinti and Roma were forcibly sterilized.",

              "history": "The German army occupied Denmark on 9 April 1940. Until 1943, the occupation regime appeared relatively benign: It dominated foreign policy, but allowed the Danish government complete autonomy in domestic affairs, including control of the legal system and police forces. The tone of the German occupation changed in early 1943. Rather than yield to German demands, the Danish government resigned on 29 August 1943. German authorities took direct control of the Danish military and police forces. Other parts of the administration still remained in Danish hands. The German occupation of Denmark ended in May 1945.\r\n\r\nBefore the Second World War, Denmark had a total population of 3.85 million people. Approximately 6,500 of them were Jews. Their community consisted mostly of some 6,000 native Danes, while the rest were refugees from Central and Eastern Europe. Most Jews lived in Copenhagen, the country's capital and largest city. Considering the relatively small Jewish population and the support most Danes gave to their fellow Jewish citizens, Germany initially followed a general policy of non-interference regarding the \u201cJewish question\u201d. After the implementation of martial law in August 1943, the order for the deportation of Danish Jews reached SS General Werner Best, the German civilian administrator in Denmark, on 28 September 1943. Approximately three weeks earlier, Best himself had taken the initiative to ask Berlin if the Jews in Denmark could be arrested. However, before the arrests could be carried out, the Danish authorities, Jewish community leaders, and countless private citizens mounted a massive operation to help Jews go into hiding or into temporary sanctuaries. When German police began to round-up Jews in Denmark on the night of 1 October 1943, they had little success. The Danish resistance, assisted by many ordinary Danish citizens, organised a partly coordinated, partly spontaneous rescue operation. Within less than a month, some 8,000 refugees, mostly people who were considered Jews and their non-Jewish relatives, escaped to neutral Sweden, which accepted the Danish refugees. Meanwhile, the Germans managed to deport 472 Jews, most of whom were refugees from Germany or Eastern Europe, to the Theresienstadt ghetto. Dozens of Jews from Denmark died there before the end of the war. In late April 1945, German authorities handed the Danish prisoners over to the Swedish Red Cross. Virtually all the refugees returned to Denmark in 1945. In total, some 120 Danish Jews died during the Holocaust in Theresienstadt or during their escape from Denmark. One died in Auschwitz and one in Majdanek.\r\n\r\nDenmark has a long history of Roma presence and anti-Roma legislation. An immigration law from 1875 prohibited Roma [\u201cTatere\u201d] from entering Denmark. It was not abolished until 1953. In 1934 a group of Norwegian Roma were not allowed into Denmark and as a result they were forced to travel to Belgium. This led to their deportation to Auschwitz-Birkenau. A controversial 1938 sociological and genetic study ordered by the Copenhagen welfare authorities assessed the number of Danish Roma at 700-800. During the German occupation no measures for registration or persecution of Roma were undertaken by the occupation authorities. \r\n",

              "history": "Estonia was part of the Russian Empire in 1710\u20131918 and it declared independence on 24 February 1918. The secret additional protocol of the 1939 Hitler-Stalin Pact assigned the country to the Soviet sphere of interest, which resulted in a military occupation by the Red Army in June 1940 and annexation as a Soviet Republic in July 1940. After the German invasion from July to October 1941, the territory of Estonia on 5 December 1941 officially became part of the civilian occupation administration of Reichskommissariat Ostland as Generalbezirk Estland. At the same time, it remained part of the operational zone of the Wehrmacht. The Red Army re-conquered the Estonian mainland in September 1944 and the islands in November 1944. Estonia\u2019s independence was restored in August 1991.\r\n\r\nBefore the Second World War, Estonia had a total population of 1,126,413 people according to the 1934 census. Jews constituted a tiny minority of approximately 4,400 people who lived mostly in the cities of Tallinn, Tartu and P\u00e4rnu. During the Soviet occupation, about 400 Jews were deported as \u201cunreliable or socially alien elements\u201d to the Soviet interior. On the eve of the German occupation, some 2,000 to 2,500 Jews managed to flee from Estonia to the Soviet rear, either as part of the evacuation of industry and offices or on their own; some Jews were drafted into military service. About 1,000 Jews who remained were murdered by Einsatzgruppe A and the units subordinated to the Kommandeur der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD Estland and their local collaborators, mostly until the end of 1941. In the autumn of 1943 a network of Jewish forced labour camps was set up, mostly to exploit oil shale deposits. Up to 10,000 Jews from dismantled ghettos in Lithuania and, on occasion, from Latvia and Hungary were dispatched to these camps. Furthermore, there were transports of Jews from Germany and from the Theresienstadt /Terez\u00edn/ ghetto in the so-called Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. In the summer of 1944, a part of a transport from the Drancy camp in France was sent to camps in Estonia operated by the Security Police and SD. Male prisoners considered unfit for physical labour, as well as women and children, were usually executed upon arrival. Overall, over 7,500 of those deported to Estonia perished, mainly due to harsh labour, inhuman living conditions and targeted mass executions that accompanied the camp evacuations. Less than 1,000 Estonian Jews perished in the Holocaust, but Estonia became a killing site for thousands more Jews who had been deported from other countries.\r\n\r\nAccording to a December 1941 German census, there were 743 Roma in Estonia with a little more than half of them living in cities. Under German occupation, Roma were subject to arrest, imprisonment and summary execution and mass shootings often carried out under German order by local collaborators. Most of Estonia's Roma were murdered in Kalevi-Liiva near Tallinn. The exact number of Roma murdered is unknown. Estimates put the number of persecuted Roma between 800-1000 with only 5-6% of them surviving the war.",

During and after the Civil War, the regime was responsible for the murder of around 150,000 political opponents and the incarceration of several hundred thousands in concentration and slave labor camps. Under Franco\u2019s rule, Spain stayed neutral throughout the Second World War, but did send volunteers, the so-called Blue Division, to fight alongside the Axis Powers against the Soviet Union. The Spanish regime was complicit in the persecution and deportation of nearly 15,000 Spanish Republican exiles from German-occupied France to concentration camps within the Reich. \r\n\r\nWhen the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, Spain had a total population of about 24.8 million people; approximately 6,000 of them were Jews. An additional 13,000 Jews lived in Spanish Morocco without Spanish citizenship. During the Civil War, many Jews left Spain, fearing the Fascists and their Axis allies. Antisemitism was an inherent part of the Franco Regime. While immigration became more complicated for the Jews, due to an antisemitic passage in the Frontier Law of 1939, approximately 20,000 to 30,000 refugees of diverse backgrounds, many Jewish, were able to leave Europe through Spain. Even though the character of the regime slowly changed during the 1950s, it maintained antisemitic legislation in certain fields (such as the medical professions). \r\n\r\nThere are no sufficient findings on the situation of Roma in Spain during the Second World War.

              "history": "Finland was part of the Russian Empire since 1809. Having declared independence in December 1917, the country became involved in the Second World War by the Molotov-Ribbentrop Agreement of August 1939, which assigned Finland to the Soviet sphere of influence, and the resulting Soviet assault in November 1939. The ensuing \u201cWinter War\u201d was ended by the Finnish-Soviet Peace Treaty in March 1940 and cost Finland about ten percent of its territory, including the city of Vyborg (Viipuri). On 26 June 1941, the country joined Hitler\u2019s war against the USSR to recoup the losses incurred the year before. After achieving its objectives, Finland did not wish to join in Nazi Germany's wider war aims and did not, for instance, participate in the German attack on Leningrad. However, Finland rejected a Soviet peace offer made in April 1944 and it was the Red Army\u2019s offensive two months later which forced Finland to sign an armistice in September 1944. After this, Finnish troops forced the German military in the country to withdraw to still-occupied Norway. Finland formally declared war on Germany in March 1945.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War, Finland had a total population of approximately 3,695,000 inhabitants. There were about 2,000 Jews among them, most of them Finnish citizens. In addition, a few hundred foreign-born Jews had been admitted to the country as refugees in the 1930s. Between 1941 and 1944, the treatment of Jews in Finland depended to a large degree on their legal status: Finnish Jews had the same rights and obligations as their fellow citizens. Foreign Jews, on the other hand, were subjected to police surveillance and threatened with deportation even for minor infractions. Twelve Jewish refugees were handed over to the German authorities by the Finnish Ministry for Internal Affairs and the Security Police. More than 700 Jews were most at risk, as they were part of the 60,000 Soviet prisoners-of-war in Finnish captivity. As a result of Finnish-German Security Police co-operation, the Finnish Security Police and military authorities handed over 521 \u201cundesirable\u201d Soviet prisoners-of-war, including more than 50 Soviet Jews, to the German Security Police for execution. The Germans showed no acute interest, however, in the remaining Jews in Finnish custody. When Finland began to disentangle itself from the war in 1943, the country gradually relaxed its policy towards foreigners and prisoners-of-war. \u201cUndesirable\u201d prisoners were no longer handed over to the Germans and a settlement with the Swedish government was negotiated, providing for the transfer of Jewish refugees to Sweden.\r\n\r\nFinland's Roma population was estimated to be around 4,000 people in 1939. While no Finnish Roma were handed over to the Germans, the Roma community faced discrimination and hostility. The 1,500 Karelian Roma who had to leave after the \"Winter War\" between Finland and the Soviet Union 1939/1940 were not allowed to return between 1941 and 1944, unlike the rest of the Karelian population. Attempts to implement plans by the Finnish state to put all Roma in labour camps were unsuccessful. Some 300 Roma fought in the Finnish army which has contributed to a positive memory of the Second World War and a heightened sense of equality and community with the wider Finnish society. This has been encouraged by both Finland's Roma community and the Finnish state.",

General de Gaulle, established a government-in-exile in London, Free France, which joined the Allies and supported the Resistance. According to the armistice, Germany de facto annexed the regions of Alsace and Lorraine, while the rest of France was principally divided into a small demilitarized Italian zone in the south east and two large parts: the Occupied Zone and the Free Zone. The first encapsulated Northern France and the Atlantic Coast and was placed under German military control. Southern France remained unoccupied and was placed under the control of a new French government, headed by Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain. In response to the Allied landings in North Africa in November 1942, German and Italian forces also occupied the Southern Zone. When Italy attempted to surrender to the Allies in September 1943, the Germans took over the Italian zone of France. The liberation of France began with the Allied landings in Normandy on 6 June 1944. Two months later, on 25 August, the German forces in Paris surrendered.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1940, France had a total population of 40,690,000 inhabitants. Some 300,000 to 350,000 were Jewish, with 145,000 living in the Southern Zone. About half of the Jewish population were not French citizens, but Jews who had moved to France after the First World War or had arrived as Jewish refugees during the 1930s. Almost immediately after the occupation, Jews in both zones were subjected to a first wave of anti-Jewish measures. In the German-controlled zone, Jews were removed from their jobs, their freedom of movement was restricted, and many were arrested. At the same time, the Vichy government actively commenced persecuting Jews. In October 1940, it passed a set of anti-Jewish laws called the Statut des Juifs [Jewish Statute]. In March 1941, the Vichy authorities set up a General Commissariat for Jewish Affairs [Commissariat G\u00e9n\u00e9ral aux Questions Juives]. In June 1942, the Germans forced the Jews in the occupied zone to wear the Jewish badge for easy identification, began arresting large groups, and restricted the movements of the remaining community. The \u201cround-ups\u201d [\u201crafles\u201d] were carried out by the French police in summer 1942. The most notable was the roundup of the V\u00e9lodr\u00f4me d'Hiver or V\u00e9l d\u2019Hiv in Paris. There, about 13,000 Jews (men, women and children) were rounded up, and some 7,000 of them were jammed into the V\u00e9l d\u2019Hiv in deplorable conditions. Many thousands of Jews were arrested and sent to transit camps, mostly to Drancy, Compi\u00e8gne and Pithiviers, from where they were deported to Nazi-occupied Poland. The Vichy authorities also arrested and deported approximately 7,000 Jews from their zone in the summer of 1942. Altogether, 42,500 Jews were sent to Nazi-occupied Poland during 1942. Nearly one third of them came from unoccupied France. German authorities resumed transports of Jews from France in January 1943 and continued the deportations until August 1944. In total, approximately 80,000 Jews were deported from France. Some 70,000 were sent to Auschwitz, while the others were sent to Majdanek, Sobibor and, in smaller numbers, to Buchenwald. Among the deportees, only 2,000 survived. Others died in detention on French soil.\r\n\r\nIn 1939, it is estimated that there were around 40,000 \"nomades\" (e.g. Sinti/Manouches, Roma, Gitans, Yenish) living in France. Already on 6 April 1940, before the German occupation of France, the government ordered the arrest of \"nomades\" in camps. Others were put under house arrest. Discrimination and restrictions on freedom of movement intensified under German occupation. More than 30 detention camps existed during the Second World War in both the occupied and free zones of France, with approximately 6,500 Sinti and Roma interned. A lot of inmates tried to flee; a significant number of Sinti and Roma fought in the resistance movement. Some were deported to Germany and did not survive. Some of the detention camps existed until May 1946, when the government repealed the decree.\r\n\r\nNote: The former French colonies are discussed in country reports under their present-day name.",

An archival catalogue is available online (not including data relating to the privacy of individuals mentioned).\r\n\r\nEqually important are the National Archives, which hold administrative records created by several ministries and other central public bodies during the Vichy regime; Vichy and post-war legal proceedings; and documents donated by survivors. At a more local level, the Departmental Archives are highly relevant for study of racial laws and their implementation. It is also worth mentioning the National Archives branch for France\u2019s overseas colonies [Archives Nationales d'Outre-mer], where the unique \u201cPr\u00e9fecture de Constantine. Service des questions juives et des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s secr\u00e8tes\u201d collection can be found. Finally, the National Audiovisual Institute [INA, Institut National de l\u2019Audiovisuel] holds Holocaust-related audiovisual material.\r\n\r\nOther important Holocaust-relevant archival institutions in France include the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, the Fondation pour la M\u00e9moire de la D\u00e9portation, the ORT-archives, the \u201cContemporaine\u201d Library (former Biblioth\u00e8que de Documentation Internationale Contemporaine which holds the archives of the Cimade), the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale des D\u00e9port\u00e9s et Intern\u00e9s R\u00e9sistants et Patriotes, Maison de la culture yiddish \u2013 Biblioth\u00e8que Medem, and the Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle."

              "history": "The United Kingdom declared war on Nazi Germany on 3 September 1939, after the German invasion of Poland. After the defeat of France in the spring of 1940, the British Expeditionary Force withdrew from the European Continent. Although the Channel Islands near the French coast did fall into German hands, from the summer of 1940 until 1945, mainland Britain resisted German invasion and became a refuge for many governments-in-exile and refugees of the occupied countries in Europe.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the war, 370,000 to 390,000 Jews were living in the UK, out of a total population of about 48 million. The Channel Islands were home to only a few dozen Jews. Anti-Jewish measures on the Islands were issued by the German military authorities in Paris and followed the timing of those in France. They were implemented by the German military administration with the assistance of local authorities. In both Guernsey and Jersey, antisemitic legislation was passed by the Royal Court. About ten Jews were deported. The Nazis operated a number of concentration and forced labour camps on the island of Alderney from January 1942 with approximately 5,000, mostly Eastern European inmates. About 890 of the prisoners were French Jewish forced labourers, at least 8 of whom died there. The United Kingdom had begun accepting refugees following the November Pogrom of 1938 when the British Government agreed to allow an unrestricted number of unaccompanied Jewish children to enter the country, a measure which remained in effect until the war broke out in September 1939. In total, approximately 65,000 Jewish refugees found shelter in the UK. British forces liberated concentration camps in northern Germany, including Neuengamme and Bergen-Belsen. \r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, there were an estimated 45,000 Roma in England, which was the majority of Roma in the United Kingdom. Despite existing prejudices, Roma contributed to the war effort against Nazi Germany in manifold ways. The UK was an important country for gathering information on what was happening to Roma in German-occupied and -dominated Europe during and after the Second World War. ",

With the Greek army defeated, the country remained under enemy occupation until October 1944. Greece was divided into three zones. Germany controlled parts of Greek Macedonia (including Thessaloniki), Thrace, Piraeus, and Crete. Bulgaria annexed Eastern Greek Macedonia and the rest of Thrace. Athens was jointly occupied by Germany and Italy. After Italy\u2019s surrender in September 1943, all Italian-occupied regions came under German rule. The Red Army\u2019s advance in late 1944 forced the Germans to withdraw from Greece. In October 1944, British troops entered Athens unopposed.\r\n\r\nIn 1941, Greece had a total population of approximately 7,370,000 inhabitants, up to 80,000 of whom were Jews. While there were Jewish communities in at least two dozen cities, the biggest one was in Thessaloniki, which totalled some 55,000 people. On 11 July 1942, all male Jews between 18 and 45 years old were gathered in one of the city\u2019s squares and beaten and humiliated for hours. After their registration, thousands of them were subjected to forced labour. Three months later, after the payment of a huge ransom, they were released. In February 1943, the Jews were obliged to wear the Yellow Star and forced to move into two ghetto areas. Between March and August of that year, up to 46,000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where most of them were murdered upon arrival. In the Italian zone, the Jews lived in relative safety until the Italian surrender to the Allies in September 1943. After the Germans took control of the Italian zone, almost all its Jews were also deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. The Jews from the territories under Bulgarian administration were deported to Treblinka in March 1943 following a Bulgarian-German agreement signed a month earlier. In total, less than twenty percent of the Greek Jews survived the Holocaust, with the highest percentage of victims from Thessaloniki and the Bulgarian occupation zone.\r\n\r\nFor this country there are no sufficient findings on the history of Roma during the Second World War. EHRI would be pleased to receive any information.",

              "history": "The Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded by Germany, Italy and other Axis states on 6 April 1941. The country capitulated on 17 April and Germans, Italians, Hungarians and Bulgarians occupied and partitioned the country. On 10 April 1941 the Germans troops entered Zagreb, and the Independent State of Croatia [Nezavisna dr\u017eava Hrvatska, NDH] was proclaimed by the representatives of the Usta\u0161a movement. The Axis powers sponsored the NDH\u2019s expansion through the incorporation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the complete Eastern Srijem region (today part of the Republic of Serbia). Conversely, they immediately and systematically began to chip away at Croatian sovereignty: Italy occupied and eventually annexed parts of Dalmatia, Hungary annexed Me\u0111imurje on the northern tip of Croatia. Both German and Italian troops had more or less free reign in their respective zones of influence, which covered virtually the entire territory of the NDH. The NDH existed until the end of the Second World War in May 1945.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War 23,000 to 24,000 Jews lived in Croatia out of an estimated total population of 2,481,000 according to the 1931 census. The NDH authorities immediately began introducing anti-Jewish measures, many also anti-Roma and anti-Serb. As in Nazi Germany, the NDH government defined being Jewish in racial terms. Between April 1941 and October 1942, the NDH decreed at least 30 laws and regulations on the national level and many more on provincial and local levels that established the status of Jews in the new state, regulated the confiscation and redistribution of Jewish property and dismantled Jewish communities as well as other Jewish organisations. On 30 April 1941, it issued three anti-Jewish laws that defined who was Jewish and determined their legal status: the Legal Provision on Citizenship, the Legal Provision on Racial Origins, and the Legal Provision on the Protection of Aryan Blood and the Honour of the Croatian People. During May of 1941, the Usta\u0161a began to conduct mass-arrests, deportations to concentration camps and the killing of members of Croatian Jewry. The NDH authorities established concentration and labour camps as well as death camps for interned Jews. There were numerous concentration camps in the territory of the NDH, the largest one among them being Jasenovac. Many Jews fled to the Italian-annexed and occupied zones of the country, where they were relatively safe until September of 1943, when Italy capitulated. Only around 4,000 to 5,000 Croatian Jews survived the Second World War.\r\n\r\nAccording to official data from 1931, around 15,000 Roma lived in territories that would be included in the newly proclaimed Independent State of Croatia in 1941. Estimates assume, however, that 30,000 Roma actually lived in this area during the Second World War. The policy towards Roma was based on racial laws and aimed at their genocidal extermination. From May 1942, Roma from the whole country were systematically deported to camps within the country, especially to the Jasenovac camp, where they were tortured and killed. Roma were also deported to camps in Nazi Germany (Auschwitz, Dachau). Part of the Roma from these territories were also interned in fascist camps in Italy. Roma were also victims of mass crimes by Chetniks (Serbian) and German military units and some Roma joined the anti-fascist partisan resistance movement. The first known Roma partisan military unit was founded in this area. It is estimated that almost the entire Roma community perished in the war, between 15,000 and 30,000. In the first post-war population census conducted in 1948, only 405 declared themselves as Roma in the territory of today's Croatia.",

              "history": "Hungary fell increasingly under the influence of Germany as the Nazi regime consolidated itself during the 1930s. When Germany began to redraw national boundaries in Europe, Hungary was able to regain territory it had lost due to the 1920 Trianon Treaty, including southern Slovakia (1938) and Subcarpathian Rus (1939) after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, and Northern Transylvania from Romania (1940). In November 1940, Hungary joined the Tripartite Pact. In April 1941, it took part in the occupation of Yugoslavia, and annexed the Ba\u010dka, the Baranya triangle, the Medimurje and the Prekmurje regions. On 27 June 1941, Hungary declared war on the Soviet Union. After Germany\u2019s defeat at Stalingrad and other battles in which Hungary lost tens of thousands of its soldiers, the Regent of Hungary, Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, initiated clandestine peace negotiations with the Western Allies. As a result, German troops occupied Hungary on 19 March 1944. However, Horthy was allowed to remain regent. Following a thwarted attempt to leave war, on 15 October 1944, Horthy was replaced by the fascist Arrow Cross government. The German occupiers were driven out of Hungary by the Red Army on 13 April 1945.\r\n\r\nAccording to the 1941 census, Hungary with its annexed territories had a total population of about 14 million, including 725,000 Jews, among them some 400,000 in Hungary proper, and tens of thousands of Christians who were considered Jewish by racist criteria. From 1938 onwards, anti-Jewish legislation effectively excluded the Jews from Hungarian society depriving them of many of their civil rights and economic opportunities. Jewish men were forced to perform unarmed military labour service in the Hungarian Army. Thousands of them perished on the Eastern front. Additionally, already in the summer of 1941, Hungarian authorities deported some 20,000 Jews, including refugees and aliens, but also Hungarian citizens. They were driven to the occupied Soviet territories, where most of them were killed by the German SS with Ukrainian auxiliaries near Kamianets-Podilskyi in Ukraine. In January 1942, Hungarian military units and gendarmes murdered about 3,500 local people, including some 700 Jews, in Novi Sad and in its vicinity, in the Ba\u010dka region.\r\n\r\nDespite serious casualties and the increasingly antisemitic political climate, most of the Hungarian Jews could live in relative physical safety until March, 1944. However, after the German invasion, a large part of Jewry in Hungary was murdered. Due to the active participation of the Hungarian government, public administration, and law enforcement, the German authorities were able to deport nearly all the Jews from the provinces, close to 440,000 people, over a period of only 56 days between 15 May and 9 July 1944. With the exception of some 15,000 people who were sent to labour camps near Vienna, all the deportees were taken to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where about 75-80% of them, mostly women, children and the elderly, were murdered in gas chambers upon arrival, the others were sent to various labour camps, mostly within the Reich.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Germans\u2019 plans, the approximately 200,000 Jews of Budapest were next in line to be locked into ghettos and then deported. From the end of June 1944, they had to live in so-called \u201cyellow star houses\u201d, nearly two thousand designated buildings throughout the city. The Jews in Budapest were spared from deportation to Auschwitz due to the course of the war. The persecution of Jews was resumed on 15 October, when the Arrow Cross Party came to power. Armed party militias killed thousands of Jews in the streets of Budapest, and tens of thousands were drafted for forced labour to build fortifications at the south-eastern border of the Greater German Reich in Austria. The remaining Jews were forced to move to a sealed-off ghetto in early December, whereas a so-called international ghetto was established for Jews with passports or protective documents issued by embassies of neutral countries. On 18 January, the Red Army liberated the ghettos. In Budapest, some 150,000 Jews survived in the two ghettos and in hiding. Between 1941 and 1945, more than half a million people, that is, two thirds of the Jewish population of the wartime territory of Hungary, was murdered by the Nazis and their Hungarian collaborators, among them 260,000 Jews from interwar Hungary.\r\n\r\nThe number of Roma living in the wartime territory of Hungary (1941-1944) is estimated at up to 200,000. Roma communities faced discrimination in the form of raids and forced labour from 1929 onwards. Anti-Roma state violence intensified after the takeover of the pro-Nazi Arrow Cross Party on October 15, 1944. From early November 1944 on, the Hungarian public administration and the gendarmerie rounded up Roma from Western Hungary, the vicinity of Budapest, and the annexed former Czechoslovak territories in the collection camp in the Star Fort of Kom\u00e1rom, where they were detained in inhumane conditions. Adults and youth declared able to work were deported to various concentration camps in Germany, including Dachau, Buchenwald, Bergen-Belsen, Mauthausen, and Ravensbr\u00fcck. Many died or were permanently injured by cruel treatment and forced labour. While family members who remained in the Star Fort were later released to go home, plenty, especially the young and the elderly, perished from hunger or froze to death in Kom\u00e1rom or on their way back. From the autumn of 1944 to the spring of 1945, several atrocities and mass executions occurred throughout the country, leading to the deaths of hundreds of Hungarian Roma, including women and children. The number of identified victims of the Roma genocide in Hungary is about 1500, but the total death toll is still subject to ongoing research and debate.",

              "history": "In March 1919, Benito Mussolini founded a movement called \u201cFasci di combattimento\u201d, which became the Partito Nazionale Fascista (PNF) in November 1921. On 28 October 1922 he organised the \u201cMarch on Rome\u201d, following which King Vittorio Emanuele III of Savoy invited him to form a new government. Mussolini transformed the government into a dictatorship and then into a totalitarian state. After Italy left the League of Nations in 1937, the \u201cRome-Berlin Axis\u201d, proclaimed in 1936, developed into a closer military alliance, the \u201cPact of Steel\u201d, in 1939. Having pursued an expansionist foreign policy in the Mediterranean and in Africa throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, the Kingdom of Italy entered the war alongside Germany on 10 June 1940. Its assault on Greece in October 1940 and the military struggles in the Balkans and in North Africa triggered German interventions. In turn, Italy joined Germany\u2019s invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. On 10 July 1943 the Allies, who had already occupied the Italian colonies in Africa (Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Libya), landed in Sicily. Two weeks later, on 25 July, the king and the Gran Consiglio del Fascismo toppled Mussolini, who was arrested. In early September, the new Italian leadership signed a separate peace agreement with the Allies. At this point, Italy's empire still encompassed the Dodecanese Islands (centred on Rhodes, today part of Greece), and extended to Greater Albania, Montenegro, and parts of Dalmatia (today part of Croatia) and Slovenia. However, the Allies were already in the process of invading southern Italy. This caused Germany to step in and occupy the remaining parts of Italy the Allies had not yet conquered. German forces also took over the Italian zones of occupation in Yugoslavia, Greece, and France. Parts of northern Italy were de facto annexed by the German Reich, designated as the Operationszonen Alpenvorland and Adriatisches K\u00fcstenland. While the king and his government fled south, Mussolini was freed from prison by SS paratroopers and was allowed to set up the Italian Social Republic [Repubblica Sociale Italiana, RSI] in Sal\u00f2, northern Italy. The war front advanced very slowly: Rome was liberated in June 1944, Milan and the North in April 1945, when German forces withdrew from Italy altogether.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Italy had a total population of approximately 42 million people (not including the colonies). Its Jewish community, one of the oldest and most integrated in Europe, numbered about 47,000 people. Unlike the Nazi party, the PNF did not include anti-Judaism in its Statute until 1938, and there were Jews who joined the PNF. Notwithstanding this fact, Mussolini veered towards public and generalised anti-Jewish action halfway through the 1930s. In the autumn of 1938, this translated into the implementation of harsh anti-Jewish legislation based on biological racism resembling the German Nuremberg Laws. Many adults were coerced into forced labour (1942) and foreign Jews saw almost all their residence permits cancelled (1938); those who stayed on were later (1940) interned in the camp at Ferramonti and in other smaller camps. Still, between 1938 and 1943 there was no systematic state violence against Jews and they were not deported. Apart from some limited exceptions, Italian authorities in the occupied territories did not grant any requests by the Croatian Ustasha or the Germans to hand over Jews. When the Germans occupied Italy in 1943, the situation of the Jews in the central and northern half part of Italy worsened drastically. Jews were arrested by both the German and Italian police and gathered in provincial camps that were situated in various buildings or in town jails; from there they were transferred to the national internment camp, first at Fossoli, then at Bolzano. Here, the German police organised their deportation. The vast majority of deportees was sent to Auschwitz. The Jews of Operationszone Adriatisches K\u00fcstenland were arrested directly by the Germans and interned in the Risiera di San Sabba in Trieste, from where they were deported directly to Auschwitz. Over 300 Jews died in massacres in various places and of the approximately 7,500 deported Jews, a little over 800 survived. Some thousand Jews took part in the Resistance. The remaining 30,000 or more lived in hiding, were able to reach Switzerland or the already liberated South. Overall, about 7,000 Jews from Italy perished during the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nAfter the First World War, there were some thousands of Roma and Sinti living in the Kingdom of Italy. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Fascist government issued various persecutory measures to prevent the immigration of Sinti and Roma. While the escalation of anti-Roma governmental measures (a procedural escalation) began as early as the end of 1937, the entry of Italy into the war in June 1940 led to a further series of measures such as surveillance and ultimately the internment of civilians who were considered as a \"threat to the state\", among them Sinti and Roma. They were deported by the Italian police to camps within Italy, sent into banishment or put under police surveillance.

After a military coup attempt in 1936, the Japanese military consolidated its control over the political system. In 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War began. Japan occupied large parts of Eastern China. Japan's stated war aim was to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, a vast pan-Asian union under Japanese domination. Japan, Germany and Italy formed the Tripartite Pact in September 1940, which is the basis for the Axis. On 7 December 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy launched a surprise attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This brought the US into the Second World War. Japan then successfully invaded the Asian colonies of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, having already penetrated French Indochina in 1940-1941. The tide began to turn against Japan following the Battle of Midway in June 1942. The Japanese military was responsible for war crimes against prisoners of war and civilians. On 6 August 1945, the US dropped an atomic bomb over Hiroshima. On 8/9 August, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and invaded Manchuria, and a day later Nagasaki was struck by a second atomic bomb. The unconditional surrender of Japan was communicated to the Allies on 14 August. \r\n\r\nWith a population of slightly over 70,000,000 in 1939, the Empire of Japan only had a small Jewish presence. The Russian Jewish community in Kobe was the largest (about 40 families in 1941). During the Second World War, Japan was initially regarded as a safe transit country and, for a limited number, a safe country of refuge, despite being an ally of Germany. Most of the German and Eastern European refugees were sent on to Shanghai in the Japanese-occupied part of China. Between 1938 and 1941, approximately 20,000 European Jewish refugees joined the city\u2019s small population of Bagdadi and Russian Jews, and in 1943, were ordered by the Japanese authorities to relocate to one small section of the city.",

              "history": "Most of Lithuania had been a part of the Russian Empire until it declared independence in February 1918. The city of Klaip\u0117da (Memel), occupied by Lithuanian troops in 1923, had to be handed back to the German Reich in March 1939. The secret additional protocol to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 assigned Lithuania to the German sphere of interest, recognising Lithuania\u2019s interest in the Vilnius area, which had been a part of Poland since the end of the First World War. As a result, Vilnius and its surrounding area came under Lithuanian sovereignty in October 1939. Some five weeks later, the German-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation reassigned Lithuania to the Soviet sphere of influence, and on 15 June 1940 the Red Army entered Lithuania. One month later, the country was proclaimed a Soviet Republic. When German troops invaded the USSR on 22 June 1941, Lithuania passed under a German civilian administration and became a Generalbezirk of the Reichskommissariat Ostland. Lithuania was re-conquered by the Red Army from German rule between July 1944 and January 1945. Lithuania\u2019s independence was re-proclaimed in 1990.\r\n\r\nIn 1939, Lithuania had a total population of some 2,900,000 people. On the eve of the German invasion, there were about 220,000 Jews among them, including approximately 80,000 Jews from the Vilnius area and some 15,000 Jewish refugees who had fled from the German-occupied western parts of Poland. Furthermore, among other refugees some 6,000 Jews left the Klaip\u0117da region after March 1939. Immediately after the German invasion began, the Jews were attacked in pogroms. The systematic mass murder of Lithuania\u2019s Jews began in the summer of 1941. By the end of 1941, nearly 180,000 Lithuanian Jews had been murdered. The remaining 40,000 Jews were mostly classified as fit for work and interned in four ghettos \u2013 Vilnius (18,000), Kaunas (16,000), \u0160iauliai (4,700) and \u0160ven\u010dionys (2,000) \u2013 or in forced labour camps. There were no mass murders in Lithuania in the period from early 1942 to mid-1943, but individual killings did occur. Then, in spring 1943, the \u0160ven\u010dionys and A\u0161menos ghettos were liquidated and more than 4,000 inmates from both ghettos were murdered in Paneriai. During the autumn of 1943, the Vilnius ghetto was also liquidated. At the same time, the Kaunas and \u0160iauliai ghettos became concentration camps under the command of the SS. In the process, some 11,000 Jews from the Vilnius ghetto deemed capable of work were deported to concentration camps in Estonia and Latvia, while 3,500 women and children were sent to extermination camps in Poland. When the Germans retreated and liquidated the Kaunas ghetto in the summer of 1944, some 1,000 Jews were killed then and there, while approximately 6-7,000 were sent to Dachau and Stutthof. At the same time, a few thousand more were sent from \u0160iauliai to Stutthof. Overall, about 200,000 Lithuanian Jews perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nBefore World War II, about 1,500 Roma lived in Lithuania. This number does not cover the Vilnius region that was part of the Second Polish Republic until 1939. Under German occupation, Roma were killed in the local fields and forests, often without any official record. First mass killings took place along the Belarusian border in the early months of the occupation, intensifying in 1942. Further executions took place at the Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s forced labor camp near Kaunas in the summer of 1943 and between May and June 1944. Some Roma managed to flee from Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s during pit extraction works and joined the Soviet partisan movement in the north-west of Belarus.  At least 134 Roma were killed at the Paneriai mass extermination site near Vilnius in 1942 and in the spring of 1944. Many Roma were imprisoned in forced labour camps such as Pabrad\u0117, E\u017eer\u0117lis, and Raudonplyn\u0117, and later hundreds were deported to Germany and occupied territories. Overall, at least 500 Lithuanian Roma were murdered during the Nazi occupation.",

The Grand Duchess of Luxembourg and her government fled to France and Portugal and, eventually, to Great Britain. In August 1940, a German civilian government was established under the leadership of the adjoining German Gau of Koblenz-Trier (from January 1941 Gau Moselland). In August 1942, Germany introduced compulsory military service for young Luxembourgers and bestowed German citizenship on collaborators (measures which caused a general strike in the country). The country was liberated by the Allies on 9 September 1944.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War, Luxembourg had a total population of some 300,000 inhabitants. Around 3,900 of them were Jews. Most were refugees who had arrived since Hitler's rise to power in 1933. From September 1940 to October 1941, approximately 3,000 Jews left Luxembourg, seeking refuge in France or Belgium. Some 700 were able to leave the German-controlled countries of Europe. By October 1941, most of the remaining Jews were old, poor or sick. In September 1940, the administration applied the Nuremberg Laws to Luxembourg and began to confiscate Jewish property. In July 1941, the Jews of Luxembourg were ordered to wear a yellow armband on their left arm and in October 1941 the Jewish badge. Many were placed in a ghetto-like camp, which soon became the assembly point in Luxembourg for deportations to the east. That same month, the deportations began; on 16 October, 322 Jews were sent to the ghetto of Litzmannstadt . Overall, 662 Jews were deported in seven transports, the last of which left in June 1943. Only 45 are known to have survived. Many were sent directly to extermination camps (Auschwitz) or passed through Theresienstadt. Of the 3,900 Jews who lived in Luxembourg before the war, 1,200 perished.\r\n\r\nSince the early 18th century, a very small group of Sinti and Roma lived in Luxembourg. The Grand Duchy systematically prevented members of the minority from entering the country, so that only a few families were living there at the beginning of the Second World War. In recent research, the names of just over 20 Sinti and Roma who were deported from German-occupied Luxembourg or as Luxembourg nationals and some of whom were murdered were identified.",

The Red Army began re-conquering Latvia in the summer of 1944, and reached the country\u2019s capital, Riga, in October 1944. The westernmost parts of Latvia were reclaimed by the Soviet Union only in May 1945. Latvia\u2019s independence was restored on 4 May 1990.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Latvia had a total population of 1,995,000 people, including some 92,000 Jews. Almost half of them lived in Riga, but there were also large communities in Daugavpils and Liepaja. During the Soviet occupation, about 1,800 Jews were deported to Siberia by the Soviet secret police. When the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 and pushed through Latvia, only about 14,500 to 15,000 Jews managed to escape eastwards. \r\nAround 75,000 Jews remained in Latvia under German occupation. German attacks on the Jews quickly escalated to mass murder. Most of the Latvian Jews who lived outside the main urban centres were murdered in July and August 1941. Between August and December 1941, the majority of the inmates of the Daugavpils and Riga Ghettos were murdered. By 1 January 1942, only some 9,000 Jews were still alive, mainly in the ghettos of Riga and Daugavpils, but also in Liepaja, where the ghetto had only been established in July 1942, or in concentration camps. About 25,000 Jews from Central Europe (mostly from Germany, Austria and Bohemia) were deported to the Riga ghetto. By 1943 most of the Jews on Latvian territory were dead. Survivors of the Riga ghetto were first sent to the Kaiserwald concentration camp and then transferred to Stutthof in September 1944. Overall, about 74,000 Latvian Jews perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nAccording to a census conducted in 1935, 3,839 Roma lived in Latvia.

More than a dozen shootings of Roma are known to have taken place in 1942 and 1943; in Jelgava (German Mitau) alone, 810 Roma were shot.

According to the secret addenda to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939, Bessarabia was, among other regions, assigned to the Soviet zone of influence. On 28 June 1940, Romania was forced to hand over Bessarabia to the Soviet Union. The new Moldavian Socialist Soviet Republic (MSSR) within the USSR was formed on 2 August 1940 mostly from six counties of formerly Romanian Bessarabia and six raions (regions) of the former MASSR. After the German attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Germany's ally Romania regained its former region of Bessarabia until the Red Army recaptured these territories on 24 August 1944. The recaptured territories thus remained within the USSR as one of the union republics (MSSR) until 1991. When the Soviet Union dissolved, the Republic of Moldova declared independence in 1991.\r\n\r\nIn 1940, the territories of today\u2019s Moldova had an estimated total population of 2,468,000 people. Some 270,000 to 280,000 of them were Jews. The Soviets deported about 8,000 Jews as \u201cclass-hostile elements\u201d to remote areas of the USSR and tens of thousands of Jews managed to escape or were evacuated to the east when the German-Romanian invasion began in July 1941. Romanian and German units began the mass extermination of the Moldovan Jews. The surviving Jews were deported to Transnistria, the area between the Dnister and Bug rivers and around Odessa given over to Romanian occupation. Thousands died in the process or later on in transit camps. Once there, some were killed in mass shootings, but many more died from disease, hunger and overwork in the ghettos and camps. Most of the Jews in the Moldovan districts in Transnistria perished in a similar fashion. Some relief sent by Romanian Jewish aid organizations reached the survivors of the deportations after the Romanian dictator Antonescu stopped his policies of extermination in 1942/1943. Overall, around 150,000 Jews from Moldova perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nRoma lived in the region of Moldova for centuries where they were subject to enslavement until the mid-nineteenth century.

After the German conquest of Yugoslavia in April 1941, North Macedonia was divided between the occupying forces of Germany (in the north), Bulgaria (in the centre and east), and Italian-controlled Albania (in the west). After Italy\u2019s capitulation in September 1943, a portion of western Vardar Macedonia briefly came under partisan control before German forces captured the territory. In September 1944, the Germans attempted to establish an Independent State of Macedonia, but without substantial military support, it ceased to exist in November 1944. Shortly afterwards, North Macedonia was declared a state-member of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia (FNRJ), later the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). In 1991, it declared independence as the Republic of Macedonia. In 2019, it was renamed North Macedonia. \r\n\r\nBefore the Second World War, approximately 12,000 Jews lived in North Macedonia.

In 1943, the Bulgarians deported thousands of Jews from the regions they controlled in North Macedonia (and Greece) at the behest of the Germans. Once they were handed over to the Nazi German authorities, they were taken to Treblinka II where they were murdered in the gas chambers upon their arrival. 7,144 Jews from North Macedonia perished in this way. After the war, there were approximately 200 surviving Jews left in North Macedonia.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War, in the area of today's North Macedonia lived the largest Roma community in Yugoslavia (officially about 24,000). Roma worked as craftsmen and traders and were of Muslim or Orthodox faith. The occupying authorities - Bulgaria and Albania under Italian control and from September 1944 Germany alone - did not implement a genocidal policy towards the Roma, but there are cases of mass crimes committed against them. Roma were also used as forced labourers. The Bulgarian occupation authorities legally discriminated against Roma, preventing them from marrying non-Roma.

Hitler soon ordered the establishment of a German civilian administration, led by Reich Commissioner Arthur Seyss-Inquart.

On 25 February 1941, a general strike broke out to protest against the German occupier. In January 1942 the Germans opened forced labour camps, and charged the Joodse Raad with finding workers to fill ever-increasing labour quotas. The same month they began removing the Jews from the provinces and concentrating them in Amsterdam. In March, the German administration started confiscating Jewish property. A month later the Jews were ordered to wear the yellow Star of David. Deportations began in mid-July 1942 and lasted through September 1944. Jews were taken to the transit camps Westerbork and Vught, and from there mostly to Auschwitz. While some 25,000 Dutch Jews managed to go into hiding after being ordered to report for forced labour or deportation, about one-third of them were eventually discovered by the Germans. All in all, less than 25 percent of Dutch Jewry survived the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nSinti have lived in the Netherlands since the Middle Ages, while Roma arrived in the early 19th century. In the 1930 census, some 11,000 \u2018travellers\u2019 were registered, only a few hundred of whom were Sinti or Roma. Under German occupation, strict measures against \"woonwagenbewoners\" were carried out and some collection camps were installed. During a nationwide round-up on 16 May 1944, 578 Sinti, Roma and travellers were interned in Westerbork camp. After a selection, 245 Sinti and Roma were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Only 31 of them survived the war.",
              "summary": "In the Netherlands, EHRI has identified over 160 repositories, and described thousands of Holocaust-relevant archival units, most of them at NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies, but also at the Amsterdam City Archives. Furthermore, EHRI identified a number of Holocaust-relevant research tools, including important online resources, but also traditional archival guides. For a full list, see the extensive report.\r\n\r\nNIOD was founded immediately after the war under the name of National Institute for War Documentation [Rijksinstituut voor Oorlogsdocumentatie, RIOD], under the auspices of the Ministry of Education, Culture & Science. In 1999 it was placed under the authority of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW). It holds important Holocaust collections, such as the archives of the German occupational administration, of the Joodse Raad and of several camps (especially Westerbork). Apart from official documentation, NIOD\u2019s collection also includes private sources, such as journals, correspondence and pictures. A joint effort of the National Archive and NIOD led to the creation of a website on Dutch WWII archival sources, [Wegwijzer Archieven WOII](http://www.archievenwo2.nl/). A thematic query on \u201cpersecution of the Jews\u201d [\u201cJodenvervolging\u201d] leads to 773 archival collections in 142 archival institutions. These cover a broad variety of institutions, national as well as local and specialised institutions. There are also private archives and documentation centres, such as the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam, which hold important Holocaust-related collections."

              "history": "Germany invaded neutral Norway on 9 April 1940, and Norwegian armed forces capitulated on 10 June. King Haakon VII and the government escaped to London, where they established a government-in-exile. The Germans appointed a civilian Reich Commissioner of occupied Norway, Josef Terboven. On 25 September 1940 the commissioner banned all political parties, except Nasjonal Samling, and in February 1942 set up a collaborationist government under Nasjonal Samling leader Vidkun Quisling which lasted until the liberation in May 1945.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the invasion, Norway had a total population of about 3 million people. Approximately 2,100 of them were Jews, including some 300-400 refugees from Germany and Austria. As the Germans prepared to invade the Soviet Union in early 1941, more and more Jews in Norway were arrested and incarcerated. In June 1941, all Jews in northern Norway were arrested. By early 1942, identity papers held by Jews had to be stamped with the letter \u201cJ\u201d, and all Jews had to fill in a \u201cregistration form for Jews\u201d. The fatal blow against Norwegian Jewry was struck by Quisling and Terboven in the autumn of 1942; in early October, all Jewish men in Trondheim were rounded up and on 26 and 27 October the Jewish men of Oslo were arrested by Norwegian police and paramilitary formations. A month later, the rest of Oslo's Jews were arrested by the Norwegian police and Norwegian Germanic SS units. Jewish property was confiscated. Some Jews were warned off by Norwegian policemen and members of the underground and managed to escape. Of the 772 Jews who had been arrested and deported to Auschwitz via Germany, only 34 survived and returned to Norway after the war. In Norway itself, 23 Jews died at the hands of the Nazis. About sixty percent of the Jewish population was able to escape to Sweden with the help of the Norwegian underground. Overall, 765 Jews from Norway perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nA \u201cGypsy clause\u201d [\u201csig\u00f8ynerparagrafen\u201d] in the immigration law, practically denying the presence of Roma in Norway, had been introduced in 1927. It was not abolished until 1956. When Nazi Germany invaded Norway in 1940, the local authorities had already forced most of the small Norwegian Roma minority out of the country. Subsequently, Norwegian Roma were registered, stripped of their citizenships, expelled and denied reentry to the country. When the Second World War broke out, these persons lived as stateless foreigners on the European continent, primarily residing in Belgium and France. In 1943 and 1944, German and local police arrested and deported 66 Norwegian Roma from occupied Belgium to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Only four of them survived the war. In occupied Norway, in 1942, individuals within the Norwegian government began to discuss plans to establish Roma labor camps as well as forced sterilization. A registry of Roma was never conducted and any plans were halted by the Soviet invasion in 1944.",

              "history": "After 123 years of foreign rule by the Russian Empire, the Habsburg Monarchy and Prussia/Germany, Poland was reconstituted as an independent, multi-ethnic republic in November 1918. Helped by the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, and occupied the Western regions of the country. On 17 September, Soviet troops followed suit and marched into the Eastern parts of Poland, which were annexed to the Byelorussian and Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republics. The Vilnius (Wilno) area, on the other hand, became part of still-sovereign Lithuania. Germany split her newly conquered territories into areas that were incorporated into the Reich [\u201ceingegliederte Gebiete\u201d], and the German administered General Government in central Poland. Meanwhile, the Polish government, which had first been evacuated to Romania and France, set itself up in London and organized underground representation within occupied Poland, thus keeping in touch with resistance organizations within the country. When Germany turned on its Soviet ally and attacked the USSR in June 1941, Eastern Poland (most of which is part of present-day Belarus, Lithuania and Ukraine) fell under German occupation as well; the District of Galicia was attached to the General Government in August 1941. Nazi occupation in Poland was ended by the Red Army, first east of the Vistula River in the summer of 1944, then in the rest of the country in early 1945.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War, the Polish Republic had an estimated total population of 35 million inhabitants. Some 3,500,000 of them were Jews. Within weeks of the invasion, about two million Polish Jews came under German occupation. Individual murders by German soldiers were not uncommon during the early days of the war and discrimination against the Jewish population in general began immediately. Jewish property was confiscated, synagogues were demolished or devastated. Jews were forced to wear badges or armbands identifying them as Jews and were gradually confined in ghettos throughout the country. By early 1941, almost half a million people had been packed into the Warsaw ghetto alone where many would die as a result of the terrible living conditions there. In western Poland, which had been annexed immediately to the German Reich, and the western part of the Warsaw region, the Jewish population was expelled further east or transferred into larger ghettos (principally Warsaw and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a). In June 1941, the mass extermination of Jews began in Eastern Poland. From December 1941, Jews were systematically murdered in the parts of Poland which had been under German occupation since 1939. The first extermination centre was established in Che\u0142mno [Kulmhof], north of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. Its victims were not only Polish Jews from the regions annexed to the Reich, but also German, Austrian and Czech Jews who had previously been deported to the Litzmannstadt ghetto. Within the framework of Operation Reinhardt, the German authorities established extermination centres (Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r and Treblinka) aimed at the extermination of the whole Jewish population of the General Government. The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in spring 1943 was crushed by the Germans and the ghetto itself destroyed. Some Jews were sent to the Lublin-Majdanek and Auschwitz concentration camps, where the majority were murdered. Jews from other European countries were also deported to these camps to be killed. While Operation Reinhardt ended in 1943, mass murder did not. The gas chambers in the concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau operated until 1944. The inhabitants of ghettos which had so far been spared found their end here: Jews from the Bia\u0142ystok and the Zag\u0142\u0119bie regions were killed in 1943, those from Litzmannstadt in 1944. At the same time, Jews were brought to Auschwitz from various countries occupied or dominated by Germany, for example Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, Hungary and the Netherlands. They were submitted to selection: the able-bodied were sent to the concentration camps, the others (including the children) were murdered on the spot. The last Jewish victims of Nazi mass murder in Poland were the concentration camp inmates, who died from exhaustion or were shot during the evacuation of the camps (during the so-called Death Marches, for instance from Auschwitz and Stutthof). Soviet Army troops were the first to approach a major Nazi camp in Poland at Majdanek in July 1944 and to overrun the previously dismantled death camp sites of Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r and Treblinka. In January 1945, they liberated Auschwitz. About 3 million Jews from within the pre-war borders of Poland did not survive the war (two thirds of whom died in the territory of present-day Poland). Approximately 13% of the Polish Jewish pre-war population survived the war, mostly as refugees or deportees in the unoccupied parts of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nPoland had a population of approximately 50,000 Roma before the war. Almost immediately after the occupation, Polish Roma became subject to pogroms and mass shootings. There are approximately 180 sites of murder that have been identified such as the killing of the Roma of Szczurowa. Local collaborators often participated in the mass killings. Since May 1940 2,500 Sinti and Roma from Germany were put into camps and ghettos in the General Government. Sinti and Roma on Polish territory were deported to concentration and extermination camps like Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka or Majdanek. It is estimated that 35,000 Roma were killed during the war.",

In August 1943, Portugal and Great Britain signed an agreement which allowed the British army to use Portuguese bases in the Azores. During the war, the country continued to export goods to both sides.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the war, Portugal had a total population of 7,722,152 people; approximately 380 of them were Jews and there were 650 Jewish refugees (mostly from Central Europe) with a quasi-resident status. About 80,000 to 100,000 Jews and other refugees were able to flee Nazi-controlled Europe via Lisbon, which was the only neutral transatlantic harbour left in Western Europe after the occupation of France in June 1940. Staying in Portugal, however, was not an option, since the country\u2019s government allowed Jews to enter on the condition that they would only use Portugal as a transit point. Various rescue projects were coordinated from the country, such as the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) \u2013 a US-based Quaker aid society \u2013 and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee which reopened its European office in Lisbon in 1940.

              "history": "After the Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement of August 1939 assigned Bessarabia to the Soviet sphere of interest, the Kingdom of Romania was pressured by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany into handing over disputed territories to the Soviet Union (Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and Dorohoi), Hungary (Northern Transylvania) and Bulgaria (Southern Dobruja) in the summer and autumn of 1940. King Carol II was forced to abdicate in September 1940. In his place, General Ion Antonescu formed a government with the far-right Legionary Movement (also known as the Iron Guard party), proclaiming the National Legionary State. It lasted until January 1941, when Antonescu suppressed a coup of the Legionary Movement and forced it out of government. On 23 November 1940, Romania officially joined the Axis alliance. Romania participated in the German invasion of the Soviet Union in July 1941. Subsequently, Romania regained Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia and also administered its own zone of occupation in Soviet territory in Transnistria. The Antonescu regime was overthrown on 23 August 1944, as Soviet troops began entering the country from the east. Romania declared war on Germany in late August that same year and went on to fight alongside the Red Army.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War, Romania had a total population of about 19 million people. Approximately 760,000 of them were Jews, which meant Romania had the third largest Jewish population in Europe after Poland and the Soviet Union. In the summer and autumn of 1940, the annexation of Romanian territory by the Soviet Union, Hungary and Bulgaria lowered the Jewish population of Romania to less than 330,000. Long before Antonescu\u2019s coup, antisemitism had been on the rise in Romania, especially in the eastern territories. The situation worsened with the rise of popular far-right movements. Pogroms and mass shootings took place in the summer of 1940, in the context of the Romanian army\u2019s retreat from territories lost to the Soviet Union, with 400 Jews shot in Gala\u021bi and 50 in Dorohoi. Another wave of antisemitic violence was recorded when the Legionary Movement was in power. After the defeat of the Legionary Movement's coup attempt, Ion Antonescu introduced systematic antisemitic measures. With the onset of the attack against the Soviet Union, Romanian authorities and Nazi Germany committed mass murder of Jews in northeastern Romania, Bessarabia, Bukovina, and Transnistria. On 29 June 1941, in the city of Ia\u0219i, about 13,000 Jews were killed in an organised massacre by the Romanian authorities as well as during the subsequent deportations. In the summer of 1941, Romanian and German units, including Einsatzgruppe D, killed tens of thousands of Jews in Bukovina and Bessarabia (territories regained from the Soviet Union). Antonescu ordered the banishment of the approximately 150,000 remaining Jews to Transnistria. Thousands died on the way, others were systematically executed by Romanian gendarmes, Ukrainian militias and German paramilitaries after they arrived in Transnistria. In September 1943, only approximately 50,000 were still alive in the \u201ccolonies\u201d, ghettos and concentration camps there. Most of the Ukrainian Jews native to Transnistria, including those of Odesa, were killed by Romanian and Ethnic German [\u201cVolksdeutsche\u201d] units between October 1941 and March 1942. In the summer of 1942, Antonescu began to back away from his extermination policy and mass deportations to Belzec were canceled. While emigration was now emphasized, no significant opportunities materialized during the course of the war. More than 280,000 Jews were murdered or died during the Holocaust in Romania and the territories under its control. Additionally, 135,000 Jews from Northern Transylvania, who were under Hungarian rule between 1940 and 1944, perished.\r\n\r\nAccording to a 1930 census there were 262,501 people who considered themselves to be of Roma descent. On May 25, 1942 Marshall Antonescu ordered a census of Roma in order to organize a deportation to Transnistria. Approximately 25,000 Roma were deported to around 100 locations in Transnistria, where about 11,000 of them died.",

              "history": "An internationally recognised independent state since 1878, Serbia joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918, which then became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. In April 1941, when Germany\u2019s twelve-day campaign against Yugoslavia led to its partition between the Axis powers and their allies, the Yugoslav government was evacuated to London. Following the capitulation, most of Serbia\u2019s present-day territory was administered by the German military under the \u201cMilit\u00e4rbefehlshaber Serbien\u201d in Belgrade. The rest of the territory was annexed by neighbouring countries: northern Ba\u010dka by Hungary; some south-east areas by Bulgaria, the south-west areas by Italian-controlled Albania; and the north-west Syrmia region by the Independent State of Croatia [Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska], which had been formed on 10 April 1941. The German occupiers were driven out of the Yugoslav capital Belgrade by the Red Army and local Communist partisan units in October 1944. Serbia then became one of six republics within the post-war Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. When Yugoslavia dissolved during the 1990s, Serbia became an independent state again.\r\n\r\nIn 1941, about 33,500 Jews lived in Serbia, among them some 16,000 lived in the German occupied areas of Serbia, out of a population of about 3,810,000. Soon, the new authorities issued anti-Jewish laws. Those considered Jews were forced to wear the Jewish badge, expelled from certain professions and restricted to living in certain areas. By the summer of 1941, all Jewish men between the ages of 16 and 60 were rounded up for forced labour. Jews also fell victim to German reprisals against the local resistance movement. Notably, the German military authorities threatened to retaliate by executing 50 Serbian hostages for every German injured and 100 for every German soldier killed; the Germans met their quota by executing Jews, hoping to avoid antagonising the gentile local population any further. By early autumn 1941, most of the Jewish men of Serbia had been imprisoned in local concentration camps, and mass executions began. By December, the majority of Jewish men, about 5,000 people, had been killed. Exceptions were made for those who were needed for forced labour. At the same time, about 8,000 Jewish women, children and elderly people were sent to a fairground which had been turned into an internment camp at Sajmi\u0161te near Belgrade. From March to May 1942, more than 6,000 inmates were killed in gas vans, while another 1,200 died of exposure or starvation. By the summer of 1942, only a very few Jews were left in Serbia, surviving either by hiding or by joining the Partisans. In total, about 14,500 Jews were murdered in the German-controlled part of Serbia during the war.\r\n\r\nIn the Bulgarian-occupied zone of Serbia\u2014Macedonia and southeast Serbia\u2014Jews were arrested in 1943 and deported to the Treblinka death camp. In the Hungarian-occupied part of Serbia, Jews were among the victims of the Hungarian killings at Novi Sad in January 1942. In the Albanian-occupied area of Serbia, the Germans, supported by an Albanian SS-Division, arrested Jews from Kosovo and Jewish refugees from other parts of Yugoslavia. They were sent to the Sajmi\u0161te camp and one month later to Bergen-Belsen. In the entirety of present-day Serbia, some 27,000 Jews out of about 33,500 (over 80%) perished.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to estimate the number of Roma in German-occupied Serbia. According to the 1931 census, 30,000 Roma lived in Serbia (excluding Kosovo, Metohia and Vojvodina). Shortly after the occupation German authorities enacted anti-Roma legal racist provisions (banned the performance of certain jobs) and deported Roma. They were deported to camps such as Banjica and Sajmi\u0161te in the Belgrade area or in the concentration camp known as \u201cRed Cross\u201d in Ni\u0161, where they were tortured and killed. One of the places of mass executions of Roma was in the area of \u200b\u200bthe village of Jabuka, near Pancevo. Roma were victims of German mass shootings of civilians as a reprisal for the killing of German soldiers. In August 1942, German occupation authorities reported that the \u201cGypsy question\u201d had been \u201csolved\u201d in Serbia. Roma were also victims of Chetnik military units and the Hungarian occupation authorities, and some of them joined the anti-fascist partisan movement. While the number of victims of the shootings in 1941 and early 1942 can be estimated at around 2,500, there are no reliable figures for the total number of Roma victims in German occupied Serbia (which is in some cases estimated at 20,000). In the first post-war population census conducted in 1948 in the territory of today's Serbia (including the areas of Vojvodina, Kosovo and Metohija) 52,181 Roma were enumerated.",

Unable to resume the offensive on the entire eastern front in the spring of 1942, they opted for a push towards the south-east, occupying all of Ukraine in the process and reaching the Northern Caucasus by August 1942. At this point, Germany had captured a vast geographical space between besieged Leningrad and the Northern Caucasus. All the German-occupied territory of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, including the Crimean Peninsula, came under German military administration. Most of it was liberated again by the Red Army in 1943. Soviet troops returned to the North Caucasus in January-February 1943 and to central-western Russia mainly in the summer and autumn of 1943. The western regions of the Soviet Union remained under German rule until 1944.\r\n\r\nIn 1939, some 109,000,000 people lived in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. On the eve of the invasion, there were some 207,000 Jews in the territories that were to come under German occupation, about one percent of the total population in that area. During the first months of the war, most Jews either managed to escape on their own, or they were evacuated by the Soviet government, generally to the Northern Caucasus and to southern Russia. Jewish evacuees were relocated to southern Russia until mid-December 1941. This area came under German occupation in 1942. Due to the speed of the German advance, however, and poor means of transportation, a considerable number of Jews could not get away in time and found themselves under German occupation. The German murder campaign against the Jews on Russian territory was carried out by the Einsatzgruppen. It started as early as summer 1941 in the northwest and in many places in the central-western region of Russia and lasted until the beginning of 1943. In the south-western territories of Russia, including the Northern Caucasus, which were occupied only between July and November 1942, the murder of the Jews began later and the period of extermination was very short. According to estimates, the extermination of the Jews in Russia between 1941 and 1943 left between 60,000 and 100,000 dead.\r\n\r\nAccording to a census in 1939, there were 88,242 \u201cTsygane\u201d living in the territory of the Soviet Union, the vast majority (61,262) of whom lived in the territory of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR; at the time including Crimea). In the context of the nationality policy of the 1920s and 1930s, Roma activists had founded their own organization, cultural institutions like the theatre Rom\u0117n and some kolkhozes. In the German-occupied areas of Russia, Roma were executed in mass shootings, which began in the spring of 1942 (Crimea was a special case: there, Roma were murdered as early as the autumn of 1941). Many Roma fought in the Red Army or joined the partisan movement. It is estimated that up to 20,000 Roma were murdered in the territory of the RSFSR.",
              "summary": "EHRI has identified a number of helpful archival guides on Russia, some of which are available online. A list is provided in the extensive report. Preliminary contact with key Holocaust research and archival institutions in Russia has been established in order to facilitate future exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in the country. In order to identify the Russian archival institutions which store Holocaust-relevant resources, EHRI relied on expert knowledge readily available in EHRI\u2019s partner institutions, such as Yad Vashem and the Warsaw-based Jewish Historical Institute [\u017bydowski Instytut Historyczny, \u017bIH]. As a result, EHRI has identified over 50 archives which either certainly hold Holocaust-relevant material or can be expected to do so. While the full list can also be found in the extensive report, at least five central institutions should be named here:\r\n- the State Archives of the Russian Federation (GARF) in Moscow, which include the files of the Extraordinary State Committee to Investigate German Fascist Crimes Committed on Soviet Territory, the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee files as well as the Nuremberg Collection;\r\n- the Russian State Archives of Socio-Political History (RGASPI) in Moscow, which hold the files of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the General Headquarters of the Partisans in the Soviet Union with reports on the occupied areas. Based on the results of a joint survey of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Yad Vashem, EHRI has integrated several collection descriptions from RGASPI;\r\n- the Central Archives of the Russian Defence Ministry (TsAMO) in Podolsk, which hold reports from Red Army records (Main Political Administration of the Red Army, GLAVPUR) resembling those of the Partisan\u2019s General HQ in RGASPI and store \u201ctrophy\u201d (captured) documents mostly of German provenance;\r\n- the Russian State Military Archives [Rossiiskii gosudarstvennyi voennyi arkhiv, RGVA], which house a large number of similarly captured collections not only of German provenance, but also many related to the Jewish communities in France, Belgium, Greece, Austria etc.; and\r\n- an extensive collection of interviews with local citizens and Red Army servicemen conducted right after the liberation of territories of the Soviet Union is held by the Scientific Archive of the Russian History Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences\r\n\r\nRegional archives hold local files generated by the abovementioned Extraordinary Commission, as well as material from local occupation administrations such as administrative files, lists of persecuted or displaced citizens, propaganda newspapers etc. Most documents related to Holocaust can be found in two types of collections: in the fonds of the local Extraordinary Commission and in the fonds of the Partisan movement. The Extraordinary Commission Fonds is usually held by the central State archive, while the documents about partisan movement can be found in the former party archive. In the regional centers usually there are two archives: State archives and the former party archives."

              "history": "In 1939, the Kingdom of Sweden, a parliamentary democracy, declared it would stay neutral in case of a war between the European powers. Germany\u2019s conquest of Denmark and Norway in 1940, however, pulled Sweden into the Third Reich\u2019s military sphere of influence. In this position, Sweden was no longer able to pursue its policy of \u201cactive neutrality\u201d.\r\n\r\nBefore 1939, Sweden had a total population of about 6,326,000 people. Approximately 7,000 of them were Jews. At least 900 more arrived as refugees from occupied Norway, when the Norwegian collaborationist government prepared for the deportation of the country\u2019s Jews in 1942. Since the 1920\u00b4s the Swedish refugee policy had been very strict, but faced with growing evidence of deportations and mass murder of the European Jews, and especially the deportation of the Norwegian Jews in 1942, the Swedish Foreign Ministry shifted its stance on immigration. As a result, all Jews who fled to Sweden were granted asylum. In October 1943, after the Germans prepared to arrest the Danish Jews. More than 7,000 of them managed to escape to Sweden by way of an organised flight action by the Danish resistance movement, individuals and Swedish-Jewish organisations. The Swedish authorities had also, prior to the flight action, declared that the Danish Jews would be welcomed. In 1944, Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat, issued thousands of protective papers in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, thereby protecting more than 4,500 Jews. In early 1945, Sweden was able to secure the release of some Scandinavian and other concentration camp inmates. Through the international UN-organization UNRRA and the Swedish Red Cross approximately 20,000 survivors were brought to Sweden in different phases. At the end of the war, the Red Cross organized transports of 15,500 concentration camp prisoners to Sweden, with the White Buses Operation. Most of the survivors came from Norway and Denmark; approximately 4,000 of them were Jews. After the German capitulation in May 1945, an additional 9,000, mostly Poles and Hungarians, from different concentration camps were transported by the so-called White Boats to Sweden.\r\n\r\nIn 1930, a census counted 471 Roma, who were families of the Kaldera\u0161a and had immigrated to Sweden in the second half of the 19th century. At the same time, several thousand \u201cResande\u201d (\"travellers\") lived in Sweden, whose origin went back to Roma who had immigrated in the 16th century. Roma were subject to discrimination; for example, the Riksdag had issued an entry ban on foreign Roma in 1914, which remained in force until 1954. Discussions about Roma as an alleged \u201cracial problem\u201d intensified during the Second World War and led to a census of 453 Roma carried out as part of a police raid on May 31, 1943; 7,668 Resande were separately recorded by 1944. Further measures were not taken because the State Institute for Racial Biology opposed them. In 1945, a small number of Roma and Sinti survivors were admitted to the country as part of the \u201cWhite Buses\u201d and \u201cWhite Ships\u201d rescue operations.",

              "history": "Until the end of the First World War, Slovakia belonged to the Hungarian half of the Habsburg Monarchy. After 1918, it became a part of the Czechoslovak Republic. Following the Munich agreement of September 1938, Slovakia declared autonomy. A single-party regime came to power, with Jozef Tiso as prime minister. In November 1938, the country lost much of its southern territories to Hungary. At Germany\u2019s instigation, the Slovak Parliament proclaimed independence on 14 March 1939, but remained bound to Germany by a \u201cProtection Agreement\u201d. In the fall of 1939 Jozef Tiso became president of Slovakia. Internally, Slovakia retained a considerable degree of autonomy, especially in its anti-Jewish policy. Slovakia served Germany as a concentration area before the Wehrmacht\u2019s assault on Poland and joined Hitler\u2019s war on the Soviet Union in 1941 as well. The rise and activities of underground groups in Slovakia in 1944 led to the country\u2019s occupation by the German army and immediate break out of an anti-German (and anti-Regime) Slovak National Uprising on 29 August 1944. The uprising was suppressed in late October 1944. Occupied Slovakia was gradually liberated from Germans by the Red Army which entered and advanced on Slovakia from the east. With the Germans leaving the Slovak capital Bratislava in April 1945, the Slovak administration ceased to exist and Slovakia became a part of Czechoslovakia once more. In 1993, the separation of the Czech and Slovak Republics made Slovakia an independent state.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census, Slovakia had a total population of 3,324,111 people in 1930. 136,000 of them were Jews whose assimilation by Slovak society was tenuous. Many had declared Jewish nationality. There was also a strong Zionist movement while others gravitated towards Hungarian culture. Slovak Jews who lived in the southern part of the country, which was taken over by Hungary in 1938, later shared the history of Hungarian Jewry (by not having received Hungarian citizenship, they were actually the first ones to be deported or included in the Labour Battalions). There were 89,000 Jews left in independent Slovakia. The Slovak government engaged in the confiscation of Jewish property and adopted various anti-Jewish laws from the spring of 1939 to September 1941. These laws were thereupon aggregated and reinforced from September 1941 into a so-called Jewish Code emulating the German Nuremberg Laws in legalising the discrimination against Jews. The confiscation of Jewish property and discrimination of Jews led to the total pauperization of the Jewish population. In order to get rid of tens of thousands socially dependent Jews, the Slovak government first started to set up labour camps for Jews and then negotiated deportations of Jews from Slovakia into territory controlled by Nazi Germany. On 25 March 1942, the Slovak government started to deport the Slovak Jews to ghettos and death camps in occupied Poland. From March to late October 1942, about 58,000 Jews were deported there and the majority of them were murdered. About 20,000 Jews were excluded from deportation (among them the inmates of labour camps), and about 5,000 fled from Slovakia or went into hiding. In 1944 about 2,000 Jews took part in the Slovak National Uprising (some of them in Jewish units). After the collapse of the uprising, an additional 13,000 Jews were deported to German concentration camps. Overall, about 25,000 Slovak Jews survived the war whereas approximately 105,000 Slovakian Jews, including those in areas annexed by Hungary, perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nThe total number of Roma living on the territory of Slovakia before the Second World War is difficult to state accurately. According to contemporary data, more than 26,000 people claimed to be Roma on Slovak territory after the territorial losses in 1938. However, a certain proportion of Roma declared themselves to be members of the majority population or other minorities. In 1927, the Czechoslovak Republic enacted a law requiring all \u201citinerant\u201d Roma to register with authorities allowing the government to enact punitive and discriminatory laws aimed at Roma. In 1939, a law was passed that stripped some of the Roma population of their citizenship. During the Second World War, Roma in Slovak territories faced forced labour and forced resettlement.  A concentration camp primarily for Roma was established in Dubnica nad V\u00e1hom. After the German occupation in 1944, more Roma were killed by German forces and members of the paramilitary organization of the  Hlinka's Slovak People's Party, and Roma communities were liquidated. In January 1945, an epidemic of typhus broke out in Dubnica, due to poor sanitary conditions and overpopulation. A quarantine was declared and it was forbidden to send any more Roma to the camp. Under the pretext of transporting them to the hospital, the sick Roma were loaded onto a truck and taken to the local arms factory where 26 of them were murdered. The murders of Roma also took place in other places such as Kremni\u010dka and Nemeck\u00e1. ",

Furthermore, Yad Vashem possesses a number of collections which are relevant to Holocaust-research on Slovakia.

At the same time as EHRI had started its identification and investigation work, the National Archives of Belgium commenced a project which aimed to produce a guide to sources on Jewish life in Belgium. EHRI closely cooperated with this project\u2019s directors and researchers. The identification of repositories holding Holocaust-related collections dramatically improved thanks to this collaborative identification work. \r\n\r\nOne of the most important Belgian archives for Holocaust research is Kazerne Dossin: Memorial, Museum and Research Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights. This museum and research centre actively collects material, often private collections, about the Holocaust in Belgium. It holds the largest collection of materials on the topic in Belgium, including original, photocopied and scanned materials. EHRI supported Kazerne Dossin by helping them transfer the existing texts into archival descriptions according to international archival standards and integrating new descriptions into this system. This resulted in a major step forward for Kazerne Dossin: from 17 collection descriptions, Kazerne Dossin now provides EHRI with hundreds of descriptions. It is continuing this effort in order to make all its materials publicly available on a collection level.\r\n\r\nMade up of the National Archives, 17 State Archives in the Provinces, the Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (CEGESOMA); and the Directorate-General for War Victims, the State Archives are another significant institution that hold Holocaust-related material. In particular, the National Archives branch in Brussels conserve the archive of the former Military Justice system, which includes all the post-war trial records. Some important city (and communal) archives also have Holocaust-related material, such as those of Brussels, Antwerp, Li\u00e8ge, Charleroi and Ghent. Moreover, EHRI has worked closely CEGESOMA. Collection descriptions from the Centre were selected via key-word selection and literature search (verification of bibliographies of key works on the Holocaust in Belgium) and integrated onto the Portal by EHRI. This export includes archival documents, manuscripts, interview descriptions, and photo descriptions. As for the Directorate-General for War Victims, it possesses one of the largest and most important collections on the Holocaust in Belgium from the victims\u2019 perspective.\r\n\r\nThere are also several important private archival institutions in Belgium. Notably, the Jewish Museum of Belgium in Brussels, which holds important sources related to the victims, as do some remembrance organisations, such as the Auschwitz Foundation and the Foundation of Contemporary Memory, which collect testimonies.\r\n\r\nMany other sources are stored in repositories outside of Belgium. First of all, there are the archives of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (with branches in New York and Jerusalem) and the World Jewish Congress records on Belgium (stored at the Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati). The Yad Vashem archives hold both original and copied materials on Jews in Belgium, including the original documents of the Belgian Jewish Committee in London during the Second World War. Likewise, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum holds vast materials on Jews in Belgium, both originals and copies. Their copy collection on Belgium includes copies from Kazerne Dossin, the Directorate-General for War Victims, CEGESOMA, and the National Archives (Foreigners\u2019 Police archives, Br\u00fcsseler Treuhandgesellschaft collection, Archive of the Diamond collection and other files).

It holds important Holocaust collections, such as the archives of the German occupational administration, of the Joodse Raad and of several camps (especially Westerbork). Apart from official documentation, NIOD\u2019s collection also includes private sources, such as journals, correspondence and pictures. A joint effort of the National Archive and NIOD led to the creation of a website on Dutch WWII archival sources, [Wegwijzer Archieven WOII](http://www.archievenwo2.nl/). A thematic query on \u201cpersecution of the Jews\u201d [\u201cJodenvervolging\u201d] leads to 773 archival collections in 142 archival institutions.

As a result, EHRI has identified over 50 archives which either certainly hold Holocaust-relevant material or can be expected to do so. While the full list can also be found in the extensive report, at least five central institutions should be named here:\r\n- the State Archives of the Russian Federation (GARF) in Moscow, which include the files of the Extraordinary State Committee to Investigate German Fascist Crimes Committed on Soviet Territory, the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee files as well as the Nuremberg Collection;\r\n- the Russian State Archives of Socio-Political History (RGASPI) in Moscow, which hold the files of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the General Headquarters of the Partisans in the Soviet Union with reports on the occupied areas. Based on the results of a joint survey of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Yad Vashem, EHRI has integrated several collection descriptions from RGASPI;\r\n- the Central Archives of the Russian Defence Ministry (TsAMO) in Podolsk, which hold reports from Red Army records (Main Political Administration of the Red Army, GLAVPUR) resembling those of the Partisan\u2019s General HQ in RGASPI and store \u201ctrophy\u201d (captured) documents mostly of German provenance;\r\n- the Russian State Military Archives [Rossiiskii gosudarstvennyi voennyi arkhiv, RGVA], which house a large number of similarly captured collections not only of German provenance, but also many related to the Jewish communities in France, Belgium, Greece, Austria etc.; and\r\n- an extensive collection of interviews with local citizens and Red Army servicemen conducted right after the liberation of territories of the Soviet Union is held by the Scientific Archive of the Russian History Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences\r\n\r\nRegional archives hold local files generated by the abovementioned Extraordinary Commission, as well as material from local occupation administrations such as administrative files, lists of persecuted or displaced citizens, propaganda newspapers etc. Most documents related to Holocaust can be found in two types of collections: in the fonds of the local Extraordinary Commission and in the fonds of the Partisan movement.

EHRI approach to Austria: Pre-existing research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Austria, EHRI could rely on a number of pre-existing works on the Holocaust. Highly useful for EHRI\u2019s identification efforts was a general overview of archives in Austria, Germany and Switzerland:\r\n\r\n[2009] *Archive in Deutschland, \u00d6sterreich und der Schweiz. Ein Adressenverzeichnis* (M\u00fcnster: Ardey, 2009). Book + CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n[2023] *Archive in Deutschland, \u00d6sterreich und der Schweiz. Adressenverzeichnis 2023/2024* (M\u00fcnster: Ardey, 2023). Book + CD-ROM\r\n\r\nThe publications of the Austrian Historians\u2019 Commission [\u00d6sterreichische Historikerkommission], which are available and searchable online at http://www.boehlau.at/histkom, are also helpful. Furthermore, the following platform is an important and specifically Holocaust-relevant online resource:\r\n\r\nNS-Quellen\r\nThis resource is dedicated to issues of expropriation between 1938 and 1945, and to issues of restitution and compensation after 1945. The platform itself is an entry point. Researchers will find detailed information about resources that can provide them with valuable assistance in their research (for example: In which Austrian archives can I find documents on expropriation? Where can I conduct research on citizenship revocation?; or how? How can I find out whether a specific property or rental was \u201caryanised\u201d?). The platform offers an overview of the legal foundations of both the Nazi expropriation of property as well as restitution and compensation from the Republic of Austria after 1945. It gives direct access to the original texts of all the laws relevant to this context. There are also bibliographic references and explanations of individual terms. The information is in German. See here: (http://ns-quellen.at)\r\n\r\nInformation about further digital resources and services in Austria can be found on the website of EHRI Austria: https://www.ehri.at/en/projects/ \r\n\r\nAmong the more traditional research tools, the following guide is worth mentioning:\r\n[1995, 1991] Boberach, Heinz (Ed.), *Inventar archivalischer Quellen des NS-Staates. Die \u00dcberlieferung von Beh\u00f6rden und Einrichtungen des Reichs, der L\u00e4nder und der NSDAP*, 2 Teile, (Munich: Saur, 1991, 1995). Also included in the commercial database \u201cDeutsche Geschichte im 20. Jahrhundert Online: Nationalsozialismus, Holocaust, Widerstand und Exil 1933-1945\u201d, http://db.saur.de/DGO.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Austrian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAustria exhibits a highly differentiated archival system without much centralisation. In addition to the Federal Archives and its departments (governed by the Bundesarchivgesetz), each of the Austrian Bundesl\u00e4nder has its own State Archive (each governed by the respective state Archivgesetz or statute). There are over 50 city archives. The religious communities in Austria, first and foremost bodies and organisations of the Catholic Church, exhibit a rich array of archival institutions. University archives, archives of noble houses (in particular the Liechtenstein archives) and a number of other, mostly topical archives as well as libraries holding archival material also exist.\r\n\r\nKey institutions identified by EHRI include the Austrian State Archive (\u00d6sterreichisches Staatsarchiv/ Archiv der Republik), which has an online search engine (http://www.archivinformationssystem.at/suchinfo.aspx), and the respective state archives of the Austrian Bundesl\u00e4nder, which hold surviving files of central and regional administrative bodies as well as post-war investigations. Likewise important are the state operated Archive of the Mauthausen Memorial, which contains files of the Mauthausen concentration camp complex; the Dokumentationsarchiv des \u00d6sterreichischen Widerstandes (D\u00d6W), which contains material from private hands as well as serving as a hub for highly pertinent copied files accrued from dozens of archives; the Archive of the Jewish Community Vienna (Archiv der IKG Wien), which contains the files of the Vienna Jewish community encompassing the vast majority of Austrian Jews; the Vienna Wiesenthal Institute; for Holocaust Studies (VWI); and the Forschungsstelle Nachkriegsjustiz, which has collected the scattered information on post-war trials for Nazi war crimes.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Austria**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Austria**\r\n\r\nIn Austria, EHRI has identified over 200 state, municipal and church archives. While well over 25% of these archives are clustered in or around Vienna, there are also important archives in all Austrian Bundesl\u00e4nder.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Austria, material relevant to the Holocaust in Austria can be found in a number of institutions, including the German Bundesarchiv and the Arolsen Archives in Germany, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University, Yad Vashem, the Central Archive of the Jewish People in Jerusalem, the Wiener Holocaust Library in London, the Leo Baeck Institute in Jerusalem, New York/Berlin, and London, the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam as well as the National Archives of Hungary and the Hungarian Jewish Archives in Budapest, the Historical Jewish Institute in Warsaw, and the Jewish Museum in Prague.

EHRI approach to Bosnia-Herzegovina: Pre-existing research, available archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nResearch conducted on the subject of the Holocaust in Bosnia and Herzegovina is still under development. In the last decade there has been some increase in research and interest in Holocaust-relevant sources, but mainly from outside the country (studies produced were either funded by the European Union or conducted by researchers from abroad). Sources that were particularly relevant to EHRI\u2019s survey work include the following monographs: Anisa Hasanhnod\u017ei\u0107, Rifet Rustemovi\u0107, *After the traces of our neighbours: Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Holocaust* (Sarajevo: Institut za istoriju, 2015); Rusmir Aga\u010devi\u0107, *Snovopri\u010de o Sefardima i A\u0161kenazima travni\u010dkim* (Zagreb, 2013); Jakov Danon, Verica M.

EHRI also relied on dozens of written articles published in several journals (*Most, Ba\u0161tina sjeveroisto\u010dne Bosne, Jevrejski pregled, Jevrejski glas, Sefarad 92*, etc.), memoirs and previously conducted surveys and copies of relevant documentation performed by third parties, mainly by the USHMM, are also useful. EHRI has also identified a helpful guide which contains general information about Bosnian archives:\r\n\r\n- Bakar\u0161ic\u0301, Kemal, *Fragmenti kulturne historije Bosne i Hercegovine* (Sarajevo: Magistrat, 2005).\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s archival system**\r\n\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina has a heavily decentralized political structure that is reflected in its archival system as well. The central archival institution, the Archives of Bosnia-Herzegovina, is located in Sarajevo, the capital city. The majority of relevant records for Holocaust research are stored there, but the institution has no control over other archives in the country. There are two provincial (entity\u2019s) archives, the \u201cArchive of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina\u201d, which does not hold Holocaust-related material, and \u201cArchive of Republika Srpska,\u201d which operate in their respective political entities, which were formed by the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995. Besides them, there is an archive in the District of Br\u010dko. As with the Archive of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Br\u010dko archives does not hold Holocaust-related material. The Archive of Republika Srpska has several branches, but it operates as a centralized institution, with headquarters in Banja Luka. Moreover, the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, besides having its archival institution, also has cantonal (county) archives. These archives operate in most of the cantons (Travnik, \u0160iroki Brijeg, Biha\u0107, Mostar, Tuzla, Gora\u017ede, Sarajevo). However, these institutions are independent and work under their own, cantonal laws. This heavily decentralized archival system can sometimes be a hindrance to efficient research. It is also worth noting that most of the archives are still in development, which can further delay research and availability of records.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Bosnia and Herzegovina**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Bosnia and Herzegovina**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified a number of archival institutions and other types of organisations which hold Holocaust-relevant documents and has described over 60 collections. The Archives of Bosnia-Herzegovina are the most important institution in possession of Holocaust-relevant material as they hold a vast collection from the Second World War period and from the Research Commission of Crimes Committed by Occupying Forces. Furthermore, the Jewish Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina [Muzej Jevreja Bosne i Hercegovine], which is a branch of the Museum of Sarajevo [Muzej Sarajevo], the Historical Archives Sarajevo [Historijski arhiv Sarajevo] and the archives of Jewish communities (Sarajevo, Doboj, Mostar and others) have documents that are relevant for Holocaust research. The collections and fonds of these institutions cover a broad range of documentation, but they mostly contain administrative, political and judicial documentation created by authorities (local or higher levels), organizations, military structures, etc.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Bosnia and Herzegovina, EHRI was able to identify a significant number of Holocaust-related collections at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, which holds selected records from several Bosnian archives (Travnik, Tuzla, Sarajevo), individuals and communities. Relevant material can also be found in other former Yugoslav countries, namely, Serbia and Croatia. The Jewish Museum in Belgrade (Serbia) and the Croatian State Archives (in Zagreb) contain numerous collections related to Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s Jews and the Holocaust."

EHRI approach to Belgium: Pre-existing research and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nTwo official research projects, commissioned by the Belgian State, that have been carried out by CEGESOMA and others, have mapped a significant proportion of Holocaust-related archives in Belgium. The first project, conducted in 2001, was about the spoliation of Jewish assets during the war. The second, the results of which were published in 2007, investigated the possible responsibility of Belgian national and local authorities in the persecution of the Jews. The major publications resulting from these projects were:\r\n\r\n- *Les biens des victims des pers\u00e9cutions anti-juives en Belgique: spoliation, r\u00e9tablissement des droits, r\u00e9sultats de la Commission d\u2019\u00e9tude. / De bezittingen van de slachtoffers van de jodenvervolging in Belgi\u00eb: spoliatie, rechtsherstel, bevindingen van de studiecommissie: eindverslag*, Brussels: Chancellery of the Prime Minister, July 2001\r\n\r\n- Rudi Van Doorslaer (dir), Emmanuel Debruyne, Frank Seberechts, Nico Wouters (a.l.p.d.

EHRI closely cooperated with the directors of the project at the National Archives and the two project researchers, Gertjan Desmet and Pascale Falek Alhadeff. The major publication resulting from this project was:\r\n\r\n- Pierre-Alain Tallier (dir.), Gertjan Desmet & Pascale Falek-Alhadeff, *Sources pour l'histoire des populations juives et du juda\u00efsme en Belgique/Bronnen voor de geschiedenis van de Joden en het Jodendom in Belgi\u00eb, 19de-21ste eeuw*, Brussel, ARA-AGR/Avant-Propos, 2016, 1,328 p.\r\n\r\nBefore the publication of this guide, no such archival overview existed, although there were other synopses available that dealt with periodicals and publications on Jewish history (and in the case of the latter, indirectly shed light on certain primary sources, although its main focus was on secondary sources):\r\n\r\n- Zosa Szajkowski. \u201cBibliography of Jewish Periodicals in Belgium, 1841\u20131959\u201d, *Studies in Bibliography and Booklore*, Vol. 4, No. 3 (June 1960), pp. 103-122 (Published by: Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion; Article Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/27943319).\r\n\r\n- Daniel Dratwa. *R\u00e9pertoire des p\u00e9riodiques juifs parus en Belgique de 1841 \u00e0 1986*, Brussels: Pro Museo Judaico, 1987.\r\n\r\n- Barbara Dickschen \u2014 Jacques D\u00e9om \u2014 Catherine Massange \u2014 Jean-Philippe Schreiber, *Guide Bibliographique: Les Juifs en Belgique*, Brussels, Fondation de la M\u00e9moire Contemporaine-Stichting Eigentijdse Herinnering, 2008 [updated version in 2014].\r\n\r\nIn addition to the works mentioned above, EHRI\u2019s identification work relied on many other publications on the Holocaust in Belgium as well as other archival guides (none of which were entirely dedicated to Holocaust sources). For a general introduction to sources on Belgian contemporary history, see:\r\n\r\n- Patricia Van den Eeckhout & Guy Vanthemsche (eds.), *Bronnen voor de studie van het hedendaagse Belgi\u00eb, 19e-21e eeuw* (Brussels: Koninklijke Commissie voor Geschiedenis / Commission royale d'Histoire, 2017, 3rd revised edition).\r\n\r\nFor finding aids on sources on Belgium during the Second World War in German and French archives, see:\r\n\r\n- Stefan Martens & Sebastian Remus, *Frankreich und Belgien unter deutscher Besatzung 1940-1944; die Best\u00e4nde des Bundesarchiv-Milit\u00e4rarchivs Freiburg* (Stuttgart: Jan Thorbecke Verlag, 2002).\r\n\r\n- Guy Beaujouan, Anne-Marie Bourgoin, Pierre C\u00e9zard, et.al., *La France et la Belgique sous l'occupation allemande, 1940-1944.

Characteristics of the Belgian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nBelgium has a large number of repositories, considering the size of the country, and they are a mixture of public and private initiatives. This means researchers can sometimes find them hard to navigate. When looking for basic information about victims, local and national administrations are often in possession of personal files. The majority of Jews in Belgium were not Belgian nationals (less than 10 percent at the registration in 1940). For the non-naturalized legal residents the Belgian Foreigners\u2019 Police kept personal or family files. These files are held in both local level institutions (the city administrations) and in the National Archives (central files). It is important to note that the Jewish communities in Belgium were concentrated in Brussels and Antwerp, and to a far lesser extent in Charleroi and Li\u00e8ge. Following the decree from 29 August 1942, Jews were only allowed to live in one of these four cities. But still there are interesting sources in other city archives. The case of the deportation of a few thousand Jews from Antwerp to communities in the adjacent province of Limburg at the end of 1940 illustrates this. They were allowed to return after a few months, but their stay obviously left traces in some of the local archives. These archives can be identified using (local) studies on this very specific subject, but these are very small archives with sometimes very limited collections on the Holocaust period. The foreigners\u2019 files are accessible via name registers, organised according to date of arrival in Belgium. It should be noted that public administrations in Belgium were (and are still) not allowed to register ethnic or religious background. None of the official pre- or post-war sources therefore mention \u201cJew\u201d or \u201cJewishness\u201d (unlike in the neighbouring Netherlands, for example, where religion was duly registered).\r\n\r\nIndeed, this access via names \u2013 instead of, for example, by topic \u2013 poses one of the most important challenges to locating both victim and perpetrator sources in Belgium. Important victim sources are held by the Directorate-General War for Victims, a state institution, originally founded by the Ministry of Reconstruction and now part of the State Archives. Its task was to gather information on war victims in different military archives, judicial archives, etc., in order to obtain settlement and/or victim recognition. It thus built up a huge collection of personal files and files on some organisations, such as the Jewish resistance. There is no online catalogue, only a card index system which is not publicly accessible. It is alphabetically ordered, so one has to know the name of the person whose files he or she is looking for and there are no specific references to the persecution of the Jews. There is also an inventory, but using it does not resolve the issues mentioned above.\r\n\r\nSimilar problems arise in the case of one the most important archives for the study of the perpetrators. The archives of the former Military Justice system, which hold the files of the post-war trials of war criminals and collaborators, have been transferred to the National Archives but are not publicly accessible, consultation requiring the authorisation of the *Coll\u00e8ge des procureurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux/College van procureurs-generaal*. Access is generally granted for researchers, the individuals concerned and their descendants. A research guide and summary finding aid exist.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Belgium**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Belgium**\r\n\r\nEHRI's identification and investigation work in Belgium was based on a three-pronged approach:\r\n\r\n1. Actively identifying repositories (and collections, in the case of CEGESOMA) via the bibliographies of key publications on the subject.\r\n\r\n2. Providing Kazerne Dossin \u2013 Memorial, Museum and Documentation Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights with know-how and assistance to provide shareable descriptions of its sources that meet international archival standards.\r\n\r\n3. Working closely together with the authors and directors of the research guide on *Sources pour l'histoire des populations juives et du juda\u00efsme en Belgique/Bronnen voor de geschiedenis van de Joden en het Jodendom in Belgi\u00eb, 19de-21ste eeuw*\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the identification of repositories holding Holocaust-related collections was dramatically improved by EHRI\u2019s identification work, both via its own identification work based on the abovementioned reference works and through cooperation with the National Archives and their research guide authors. At the start of EHRI, the Directory of Holocaust-Related Archives of the Claims Conference listed 7 Belgian archives while the *Guide \u00e9uropeen des sources d\u2019archives de la Shoah* provided information on 9 repositories. EHRI's portal now contains information on over 120 repositories, most of them with detailed information.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the huge gap that had to be covered has much to do with the belated interest in Holocaust documentation and research in Belgium. CEGESOMA was created in the late 1960s, which is rather late compared to similar institutions in other countries, such as NIOD in the Netherlands. Moreover, although the persecution of Jews during the Second World War was always present both in the collections and in research, it was never a central focus point. This delayed interest was very much visible when EHRI started its activities. EHRI's activities coincided with the beginnings of a research guide to Jewish sources at the National Archives, and the opening of Kazerne Dossin, so the project started precisely at a time when the topic was finally receiving wide attention in Belgium from academic, archival and public perspectives.\r\n\r\n**_Identification of collections_**\r\n\r\n*Kazerne Dossin*\r\n\r\nDue to the aforementioned challenges, the first point of call of any research on the persecution of Jews in Belgium should be Kazerne Dossin. Kazerne Dossin was originally established in the mid-1990s as the Jewish Museum of Deportation and Resistance and was located in the former transit camp Dossin in Mechelen. This museum and research centre actively collects material, often private collections, related to the Holocaust in Belgium. It holds the largest collection of materials on the topic in Belgium, including original, photocopied and scanned materials. Often, Kazerne Dossin can offer easier access to originals kept elsewhere, as it has, first of all, such a wide variety of sources in one central place and, secondly, because its database can trace multiple sources on one person, thereby giving easy access to scanned foreigners\u2019 files on victims of the Holocaust (whereas in the original archives one would have to go through the register and then request the file needed, or search for the correct microfilm) or other sources. Consulting these sources in the original repository, would require considerable effort in terms of administration and identification. Moreover, Kazerne Dossin keeps track of ongoing research and employs a team of experts in the field.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite the wealth of its sources, the archives of Kazerne Dossin remained relatively unknown to the outside world until 2015 because of the limited information available via finding aids. On its website, Kazerne Dossin originally only provided one text describing its main collections, which was regularly updated: The number of described collections fluctuated between 9 and 17 and the identifier numbers attached to the collection descriptions changed. Many of the materials \u2013 often precious private sources from victims or survivors, donated to the museum \u2013 remained hidden behind generic descriptions such as \u201cMuseum\u2019s collection\u201d or were only described in a separate Word document, stored in a folder together with the scans of the originals and only accessible to staff. EHRI supported Kazerne Dossin by helping them transfer the existing texts into archival descriptions according to international archival standards, and integrate new descriptions into this system. This resulted in a major step forward for Kazerne Dossin: the number of collection descriptions provided to EHRI rose from 17 to over 220 descriptions and Kazerne Dossin is continuing its efforts to make all its materials publicly available on a collection level. As one of the archivists stated: \u201cIt is only since EHRI came along that people here accepted the need to work according to international archival standards\u201d.\r\n\r\n*CEGESOMA*\r\n\r\nThe Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (CEGESOMA) also holds important Holocaust collections, such as as the archives of the Devisenschutzkommando, the records of the trial against von Falkenhausen, the T\u00e4tigkeitsberichte of the Military Administration and important files from the former Military Prosecutor's Office. Collection descriptions from CEGESOMA were selected via keyword selection and literature search (verification of bibliographies of key works on the Holocaust in Belgium) and integrated by EHRI's IT specialists. The export includes archival documents, manuscripts, interview descriptions, and photo descriptions.\r\n\r\n*Sources pour l'histoire des populations juives et du juda\u00efsme en Belgique/Bronnen voor de geschiedenis van de Joden en het Jodendom in Belgi\u00eb, 19de-21ste eeuw*\r\n\r\nThis archival guide was analysed and the descriptions relevant to the EHRI project, both in Belgium and abroad, were selected and added to the EHRI portal.\r\n\r\n**C.II.In other countries**\r\n\r\nMany sources are stored in repositories outside of Belgium. First of all, there are the archives of the JDC (with branches in New York and Jerusalem) and of the World Jewish Congress records on Belgium (stored at the Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati). Original documents of the Belgian Jewish Committee in London during the Second World War are available at Yad Vashem (M.22). This committee, founded in 1943 in London by Herman Schamisso, unified a group of Belgian Jewish exiles in London. Their records contain correspondence with various Jewish institutions in Belgium, England, the US and elsewhere. They also contain correspondence with the Belgian government-in-exile about ways of assisting Jews in Belgium and Jews from Belgium in exile abroad. Furthermore, the records include lists of deportees and survivors. In addition to this rich collection, Yad Vashem has both original and copied documents on Jews in Belgium, including on Jewish resistance (M.64, 0.29, 0.44). There are also indirect sources on Jews in Belgium, such as \u201cDocumentation regarding the Holocaust from the Central Archives in Moscow, 1939-1945\u201d (M.40) and \u201cDocumentation of the Central British Fund\u201d (M.56).\r\n\r\nUSHMM also holds vast materials, both originals and copies, on Jews in Belgium. Their copy collection on Belgium includes copies from Kazerne Dossin, the Directorate-General War for Victims, CEGESOMA, and the National Archives (Foreigners\u2019 Police, *Br\u00fcsseler Treuhandgesellschaft* collection, Archive of the Diamond collection and other files). A non-exhaustive list of the copies includes: selected records from the Belgian War Crimes Tribunals and Investigation Records, selected records from the Ministry of Reconstruction of Belgium, selected records from the Belgian Royal Archives, selected records related to the Pierre Beeckmans Anti-Jewish organisation in Belgium, selected records from the City of Li\u00e8ge and from the *Consistoire Central Isra\u00e9lite de Belgique*, and records relating to the Breendonk camp. The original collections include the \u201cFela and Chai\u0308m Perelman papers\u201d (Acc.nr. 2006.432). Chai\u0308m Perelman (a very influential philosopher in the fields of the philosophy of law and argumentation) founded the \"*Comit\u00e9 de D\u00e9fense des Juifs*\", the Jewish underground in Belgium. Both Cha\u00efm and Fela worked for the underground during the war. Fela opened a kindergarten called \"Nos Petits\" in 1942 and when the school closed she made efforts to hide Jewish children.\r\n\r\nGerman sources on Belgium during the Second World War are stored at, among other places, the French National Archives at Pierrefitte-sur-Seine (sub-series AJ40), and the Bundesarchiv-Milit\u00e4rarchiv Freiburg.\r\n\r\n"

Characteristics of the Bulgarian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nBulgaria has a centralised archival system. The state archival institution has changed its name and departmental subordination several times. Now known as the Archives State Agency, its current status is regulated by National Archival Fonds Act, which was adopted in 2007. The organisation of and procedures governing access to the archival records are regulated by the [Law on the National Archival Fonds](http://www.archives.government.bg/images/1279111646.doc), the [Regulation on the procedures for use the records of the National Archival Fonds](http://www.archives.government.bg/uploaded_files/Regulation_USE__EN.pdf) and the [Rules for the procedures and organization of the archival records' use in Archives State Agency (ASA)](http://www.archives.government.bg/uploaded_files/Rules-order_and_organization_of_the_use.doc). All Bulgarian and foreign physical and juridical persons may use the records held by the ASA. The structure of the ASA includes a central archive and six directorates in the regional centres of Burgas, Varna, Tarnovo, Plovdiv, Montana and Sofia. Under them are all the other 27 regional archival branches of ASA. Several other archival institutions contain documents concerning the fate of Jews in Bulgaria during the Second World War. These are the State Military Historical Archives in the city of Veliko Turnovo, the Sofia City Archive, the Archive of the Bulgarian Academy of Science, as well archives in other countries. The most significant collections outside Bulgaria can be found in Yad Vashem, USHMM and different archives in Germany and Russia. The most important information for all future researchers is the expanding digital access to huge collection of archival documents concerning the fate of the Jews in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Bulgaria**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Bulgaria**\r\n\r\nThe Central State Archives and the regional archives hold different collections connected to the persecution and protection of the Bulgarian Jews during the Second World War as well as the deportation of the Macedonian and Thracian Jews. The biggest and most important among them are the record groups of the Commissariat for the Jewish Affairs. All archives are open to researchers and users. The entire collection is in the process of digitisation. Digital open access is provided, and referred to in the EHRI archival descriptions. Given the huge volume of documents, EHRI\u2019s main aim for Bulgaria has been to present up-to-date and accurate information on the structure of the archives, contacts, logistical information, as well as a description of the volume of documents and a general content description of the main branches of the State Agency Archives and of the Central State Archives itself. EHRI has been able to provide up-to-date summaries of the structure of the fonds, the quantities of documents, as well as descriptions of a small number of representative archival units in these inventories. For example, the Fonds of Commissariat of Jewish Affairs [\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043f\u043e \u0435\u0432\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u044a\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438 \u2013 \u041a\u0415\u0412], which is available at the State Archives Agency, contains 15,348 archival units organised in three inventories. The EHRI portal includes links to the Archives State Agency for a number of digitized documents concerning the persecution and protection of Jews in Bulgaria during the Second World War.\r\n\r\n**C.II. Outside of Bulgaria**\r\n\r\nEHRI was able to identify, among other institutions, the German Bundesarchiv in Berlin Lichterfelde and Freiburg, the Politisches Archiv des Ausw\u00e4rtigen Amtes, and Yad Vashem in Israel. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has copied a considerable quantity of Holocaust-relevant archival material from Bulgaria based on the collection of the State Agency Archives. All finding aids links are provided in the EHRI portal.\r\n"

Characteristics of the Belarusian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nMost of the central and regional Belarusian archives were founded during the pre-war Soviet period and suffered, to some extent, from fighting, evacuation or occupation. A smaller number of archival institutions was created and began to operate immediately after the German occupiers\u2019 withdrawal from Belarus. There are also some more recently established archival institutions. As a result of regime changes and administrative reforms, many archival institutions in Belarus have been repeatedly renamed, which may cause some initial confusion among researchers.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Belarus**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Belarus**\r\n\r\nIn Belarus, EHRI identified over 25 archival institutions which hold or may hold Holocaust-relevant material on Belarus. Many of them are concentrated in the country\u2019s capital, Minsk, and environs. Among the numerous provincial centres, the cities of Hrodna and Mahilio\u016d each host two Holocaust-relevant archival institutions. Regional, zonal and otherwise specialised archives can be found in all other urban centres of Belarus, i.e. in Baranavi\u010dy (Baranovichi), Babrujsk (Bobruisk), Barysa\u016d (Borisov), Brest, Dziar\u017eynsk (Dzerzhinsk), Hlybokaje (Glubokoe), Homiel (Gomel), Kobryn (Kobrin), Lida, Mazyr (Mozyr), Or\u0161a (Orsha), Pinsk, Polack (Polotsk), Re\u010dyca (Rechitsa) and Viciebsk (Vitebsk).\r\n\r\nThe abovementioned Belarusian archives hold vast numbers of valuable records on all conceivable aspects of the country\u2019s general history: the Minsk-based National Archives alone stores about 1,200 fonds, and almost all regional or zonal archives hold similarly impressive numbers of collections. Given the dimension of mass murder in Belarus during the Second World War, many Holocaust-relevant collections are either known to be stored or can be expected to be found in the country\u2019s archives. On the basis of Sergej V Zumar\u2019s *Dokumente zur Geschichte des Zweiten Weltkrieges in den Staatsarchiven der Republik Belarus. Ein Nachschlagewerk / Dokumenty po istorii Velikoi Otechestvennoi voiny v gosudarstvennykh arkhivach Respubliki Belarus* (2003), EHRI has selected Holocaust-relevant collections among the general mass of sources in Belarus. The descriptions of these selected collections have been copied from the Belarusian online archival catalogue (http://fk.archives.gov.by/catalogue/).\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Belarus, EHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections that may prove relevant to Holocaust research on Belarus, for instance in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Russia. In Israel, Yad Vashem holds a significant documentation from archives in Belarus from 1930 to 1960, containing over 4,000 files. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum stores selected records from the Belarus Central State Archives and from the Homiel, Hrodna and Mahilio\u016d regional archives.\r\n"

Facing the Holocaust* (2005), works by Miroslav K\u00e1rn\u00fd, the Theresienst\u00e4dter Studien und Dokumente and other publications.

Characteristics of the Czech archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe Archival system in Czechia consists of the state archives, particularly the National Archives in Prague, and 7 regional archives, which are subordinate to the National Archival Administration [Odbor archivn\u00ed spr\u00e1vy a spisov\u00e9 slu\u017eby] of the Ministry of Interior. Two other archives, in Opava and Brno, are also de facto regional archives, but are called Zemsk\u00fd, or Land archives, for historical reasons. Furthermore, there are 70 district archives which are subordinated to the respective regional archives. In addition to the mentioned archives, there exist also several specialed and private archives, memory institutions, museums and libraries. Furthermore, there are five archives of the territorial self-governing units worth emphasising, in Prague, Brno, Ostrava, Plze\u0148 and \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Czechia** \r\n\r\n**C. I. In Czechia** \r\n\r\nCollections relating to the Second World War and the Holocaust can be found not only in the abovementioned state archives, but also in the Military History Archives, the National Film Archives, the Archive of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and the State Security Archive (which holds the archives of the former communist security services). Furthermore, there is the Terez\u00edn Memorial in the former Theresienstadt ghetto which acts as a museum, archive and research institute. Non-state institutions doing research and collecting documents on the Holocaust include the Jewish Museum in Prague and the Prague-based Terez\u00edn Initiative Institute, which was founded by former inmates of the Theresienstadt ghetto. In October 2018, EHRI imported 165 top-level archival descriptions prepared by the Jewish Museum in Prague within the framework of the cooperation between EHRI and the [Yerusha project](http://yerusha.eu/).\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nEHRI has yet to determine which archival institutions and collections outside of Czechia are relevant to Holocaust research on Czechia. Some holdings of Yad Vashem and Beit Terezin (Israel) have been included in the [EHRI research guides](https://portal.ehri-project.eu/guides/terezin). The USHMM has conducted an extended copying program in the Czech archives, in particular in the National Archives in Prague. Yad Vashem has copied a significant amount of material from the Archives of the Jewish Museum in Prague.\r\n"

EHRI approach to Germany: Pre-existing research and archival guides**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Germany, research on the Holocaust has been conducted worldwide and for decades now. It follows that a full and up-to-date account of the available literature cannot be given here. However, a reference to the 16-volume series *Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der europ\u00e4ischen Juden durch das nationalsozialistische Deutschland 1933-1945* is appropriate, especially volumes 1-16 (published 2008-2018). This series is co-published by EHRI-partner Institute for Contemporary History Munich-Berlin [Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte M\u00fcnchen-Berlin, IfZ]. All volumes contain introductions based on international research. A translation of the series into English under the title *The Persecution and Murder of European Jews by Nazi Germany, 1933\u20131945* is under preparation with the cooperation of Yad Vashem; Volume 1-5, 12 were published in 2019-2022. Furthermore, there is the series Benz, Wolfgang / Distel, Barbara, *Der Ort des Terrors. Geschichte der nationalsozialistischen Konzentrationslager*, Volumes 1-9.\r\n\r\nResearch on the genocide of the Sinti and Roma began late; the most important and comprehensive publication to date is Michael Zimmermann's habilitation: *Rassenutopie und Genozid. Die nationalsozialistische L\u00f6sung der Zigeunerfrage*, Hamburg: Christians 1996 (available online at https://zeitgeschichte-hamburg.de/publikation-detail/band-33.html). Since summer 2020, the \"Encyclopaedia of the Nazi Genocide of Sinti and Roma in Europe\", which is funded by the Federal Foreign Office, has been under development at the Research Centre on Antiziganism at Heidelberg University and has set itself the task of compiling, scientifically processing and making available the existing knowledge of the persecution and murder of Sinti and Roma in Europe (see https://encyclopaedia-gsr.eu/eng/).\r\n\r\nWith the help of IfZ, EHRI has been able to identify a number of other Holocaust-relevant online resources and archival guides on Germany.\r\n\r\nAn important online resource is the Zentrale Datenbank Nachl\u00e4sse, provided by the Bundesarchiv, at http://www.nachlassdatenbank.de/\r\n\r\nThe following archival guides are also available:\r\n- [2023] *Archive in Deutschland, \u00d6sterreich und der Schweiz.

Kahlenberg, Julius H. Schoeps und Hanno Loewy Verlag f\u00fcr Berlin-Brandenburg, Potsdam 1996-1997.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the German archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nGermany exhibits a highly differentiated archival system without much centralization. In addition to the Federal Archives and their departments (governed by the Bundesarchivgesetz or Federal Archive Law), each Bundesland has its own State Archive, governed by the respective state archive law. There are over 1,300 municipal archives. The religious communities in Germany, first and foremost bodies and organizations of the Catholic and Protestant Churches as well as the Jewish community, exhibit a rich array of archival institutions. There are also university archives, archives of noble houses and a number of other, mostly topical archives as well as libraries holding archival material.\r\n\r\nKey institutions identified by EHRI include the Bundesarchiv [Federal Archive with all its departments] and the respective state archives [Landes-, Hauptstaats- and Staatsarchive] of the German Bundesl\u00e4nder as well as the Geheimes Staatsarchiv Berlin (for former Prussian institutions), which hold surviving files of central and regional administrative bodies, occupation authorities, the Nazi Party, personnel and membership files as well as post-war investigations; similar holdings can be found in the Nazi period archive assembled by the East German State Security Service [\u201cStasi\u201d] now held by the BStU; the most pertinent municipal archives to Holocaust research include the city archives of Nuremberg and Frankfurt am Main; the archives of concentration camp memorial sites (pre-eminently Buchenwald, Dachau and Sachsenhausen), other memorials (Stiftung Denkmal, Haus der Wannsee-Konferenz) and research institutions (such as the Institute of Contemporary History Munich\u2013Berlin); the Evangelical Central Archive and the Centrum Judaicum Archiv in Berlin; and the supranational Arolsen Archives (formerly known as the International Tracing Service) in Bad Arolsen.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Germany**\r\n\r\n**C. I. In Germany**\r\n\r\nIn Germany, EHRI has identified well over 300 repositories, including a number of memorial sites and documentation centres concerning the Holocaust or, more generally, the \u201cThird Reich\u201d dictatorship.\r\n\r\nThe EHRI portal includes collection descriptions provided by Bundesarchiv (BArch), the Arolsen Archives and the Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte (IfZ). Additionally, collection descriptions from state archives, memorial site archives, university archives and the Central Archives Heidelberg have been added to the portal.\r\n\r\nThe Bundesarchiv is the main institution holding the remaining records generated by the central administrative bodies of the German Reich under National Socialist rule. As a first step, EHRI and the Bundesarchiv decided to focus on the Reich (\u201cR\u201d) and NSDAP (\u201cNS\u201d) record groups. Since almost all state administrations and Nazi Party organizations were involved either directly or indirectly with measures against Jews, no further selection of records was undertaken apart from a chronological one (i.e. collections with an end date of before and including 1932 were excluded from the import to the EHRI Portal). The Bundesarchiv also has extensive holdings on post-war dealings with the Holocaust (e.g. compensation and judicial issues), as well as personal collections and film and photo materials. Following an internal survey by Bundesarchiv, the most relevant collections in the remaining record groups, especially \u201cBund\u201d and \u201cNachl\u00e4sse und Sammlungen\u201d (mostly administered in Koblenz), were added to the portal. Descriptions from the Bundesarchiv for materials that are accessible at the Politisches Archiv des Ausw\u00e4rtigen Amtes have also been included in the EHRI portal. The Bundesarchiv Agency in Ludwigsburg holds the prosecution files of the Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes [\u201cZentrale Stelle der Landesjustizverwaltungen zur Aufkl\u00e4rung nationalsozialistischer Verbrechen\u201d]. These cover almost all violent crimes committed during the Nazi regime and the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nThe Arolsen Archives are an international center for documenting National Socialist persecution and the liberated survivors. Former victims of Nazism and their families receive information regarding their incarceration, forced labor, and if available, post-war Allied assistance. The archives provide the foundation for research and education. The Arolsen collections include original records generated by the ITS, correspondence, and copies from other institutions and archives that helped the ITS fulfill its tasks. Having exclusively records that deal with National Socialist persecution and its aftermath, almost all its collections are relevant to EHRI. In a first step, Arolsen\u2019s archivists and historians and EHRI have integrated the following sets of collections into the portal:\r\n- Incarceration and persecution\r\n- Registrations of Persons of non-German Nationality by German State Authorities\r\n- Registrations and Files of Displaced Persons, Children and Missing Persons\r\n- Special NSDAP Organizations and Activities\r\n- Death Marches/Identification of unknown dead\r\n\r\nFor IfZ, the existing archive thesaurus was used for content selection. The IfZ Archive staff agreed on a selection of keywords identified as Holocaust-related that were used to select records from the IfZ database (public entries: http://archiv.ifz-muenchen.de) to be included in a data export for the EHRI portal. Unfortunately, the export of the full hierarchical list of each individual term connected with an individual record is not technically possible at this point, so that only the lowest level of the exported term is visible in the EHRI Portal. For record groups that are currently not reflected or not well reflected in the public IfZ database, collection descriptions were manually entered after coordination with the IfZ Archive.\r\n\r\nIn an ongoing multi-step survey of state archives, EHRI has added collection descriptions from West German state archives selected according to a review of Boberach [1991] to the portal manually, with the aim of allowing for future sustainable connections and deepened coverage. For East German archives, an ongoing review of Jersch-Wenzel / Reinke / Reinke [1996-2001] may serve as a similar, even more detailed basis in the future.\r\nIn cooperation with the archives of the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site, the collection descriptions which have been written up internally so far were published on the EHRI portal in 2019.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nDue to frontier changes after the Second World War, a number of archives relevant to Holocaust research on Germany are today located in northern and western Poland, specifically in Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski (formerly Landsberg an der Warthe), Koszalin/K\u00f6slin, Olsztyn/Allenstein, Opole/Oppeln, Szczecin/Stettin, Wroc\u0142aw/Breslau and Zielona G\u00f3ra/Gr\u00fcnberg."

              "extensive": "**A. EHRI approach to Estonia: Pre-existing research and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nEHRI identified the most important archival institutions holding Holocaust-relevant material in Estonia, relying on pre-existing academic research in the field, such as Ruth Bettina Birn: *Die Sicherheitspolizei in Estland 1941\u20131944. Eine Studie zur Kollaboration im Osten* (Paderborn, 2006); *Estonia 1940-1945. Reports of the Estonian International Commission for the Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity* (Tallinn, 2006); Anton Weiss-Wendt, *Murder Without Hatred: Estonians and the Holocaust* (Syracuse, 2009). EHRI also enlisted the assistance of a local specialist and, as a result, was able to identify important collections in four central archival institutions. In a second step, these collections were described, the descriptions then translated and added to the EHRI portal, where they are now accessible in English and Estonian.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Estonia\u2019s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAn important number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created or are deposited in Estonia and can still be found in the country\u2019s archives today. Access to them is mostly unrestricted, but records containing private or sensitive data may be withheld. For instance, personal data are protected for 30 years after a given person\u2019s death, or, if the date of death is unknown, for 110 years after that person\u2019s birth, or for 75 years after a given document\u2019s creation if the dates of both birth and death are unknown. In a few cases the investigation files of the Soviet KGB or its predecessors NKGB, NKVD and others from the post-war period may be inaccessible due to both personal and sensitive data issues. That aside, researchers are allowed to take photographs from archival documents, or they can order, for a fee, digital or Xerox copies. On a practical level, a working knowledge of Estonian and/or Russian is helpful for any kind of archival research in Estonia. Most Holocaust-relevant documents, however, are in German. The local archival staff can provide help in English.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Estonia**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Estonia**\r\n\r\nHolocaust-relevant sources in Estonia are concentrated in the country\u2019s capital, Tallinn, but divided among four archival institutions:\r\n- the National Archives of Estonia [Rahvusarhiiv]\r\n- the Estonian History Museum [Eesti Ajaloomuuseum]\r\n- the Estonian Jewish Museum [Eesti Juudi Museeum]\r\n- the Estonian Film Archives [Eesti Filmiarhiiv; now Department of the National Archives]\r\n\r\nAt the National Archives of Estonia, EHRI had identified and described a number of fonds containing a limited number of Holocaust-related records. The fonds Commander of the Security Police and SD, Estonian Security Police, Estonian SSR KGB may serve as examples of fonds that are highly important to Holocaust research on Estonia. Smaller numbers of relevant sources have been identified at the Estonian Film Archives and at the Estonian History Museum; the material stored in these institutions concerns mostly war crimes investigations. The holdings of the Estonian Jewish Museum mostly concern original materials and testimonies on Jewish life from the interwar period. Four regional departments of the National Archives, holding local documentation from the period after 1944, need to be investigated. They are, however, unlikely to hold significant quantities of Holocaust-related material.\r\n\r\nEHRI\u2019s identification and description of these archival holdings has produced an easily accessible overview of Holocaust-relevant sources in Estonia that was previously unavailable in English.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Estonia, EHRI has identified more archival institutions holding, to various extents, collections relevant for Holocaust research. For instance, the National Archives of Latvia, State Historical Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacion\u0101l\u0101 arh\u012bva, Latvijas Valsts v\u0113stures arh\u012bvs] hold the collections Wehrmacht Commander in Ostland and Commandant\u2019s Office of the Security Police and the SD, both of which are relevant to Holocaust research on the Baltic States in general and to Estonia in particular. Furthermore, Yad Vashem, Beit Terezin and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum have collected and/or copied relevant material, e.g. on deportees to Estonia or from Estonian archives respectively."

EHRI approach to Finland: Pre-existing research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nIn Finland, EHRI\u2019s exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources was able to rely on some important pre-existing research in the field, such as Hannu Rautkallio\u2019s *Finland and the Holocaust* (1987) or Oula Silvennnoinen\u2019s *Geheime Waffenbr\u00fcderschaft. Die sicherheitspolizeiliche Zusammenarbeit zwischen Deutschland und Finnland* (2010), which had already made extensive use of archival sources kept both in Finland and a number of other countries. Furthermore, during EHRI\u2019s first phase, its Finnish consortium partner, the National Archives of Finland, translated and coordinated the survey and data descriptions of Holocaust-related sources for the project. As a result, important collections in two Helsinki-based central archives were identified, and some additional material in Finnish provincial archives was discovered. These collections were described, the descriptions then translated and added to the EHRI portal, where they are now accessible in Finnish and English.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Finland\u2019s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nA considerable number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created in Finland and can still be found in the country\u2019s archives today. File dispersal is minimal, thanks to negligible wartime destruction of archival material and to the concentration of the country\u2019s archival institutions in Helsinki. Access to archival sources is unrestricted, with the exception of personal data which, according to \u00a7 28 of the Population Information Act 661/2009, can only be accessed 50 years after a person\u2019s death or, if the year of death is unknown, 100 years after that person\u2019s birth. A working knowledge of Finnish is necessary for any kind of archival research in Finland, even though documents in other languages (sometimes English, French, German, but mostly Russian and Swedish) can also be found with the help of the local archival staff.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Finland**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Finland**\r\n\r\nIn Finland, EHRI has identified two archival institutions which hold Holocaust-relevant collections. Both are located in Helsinki:\r\n- the National Archives [Kansallisarkisto], and\r\n- the Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [Ulkoasiainministeri\u00f6n arkisto]\r\n\r\nAt these two archives alone, eight Holocaust-related fonds have been identified and described in both Finnish and English. The large Finnish Jewish Archives (an important part of which consists of the Helsinki Jewish community archives) is held by the National Archives. The catalogue of the Finnish Jewish Archives was translated into English for EHRI, and entered both into the local database Vakka and into the EHRI portal. It was possible to integrate the data of this large fonds using OAI-PMH or \u201charvesting\u201d (i.e. Open Archives Initiative \u2013 Protocol for Metadata Harvesting), so all levels of the description (including child items) are included.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions for the other seven fonds were done manually. As such, the National Archives also have descriptions for the large Archive of the Finnish Red Cross, and personal files compiled by the Finnish State Police (VALPO) on Finns and foreigners who were considered politically suspicious. The Holocaust-relevant sources preserved at the Archives of the Foreign Ministry, on the other hand, fit in a small number of boxes and single files, but are important nonetheless. They contain information on the \u201cJewish question\u201d and Jewish refugees, but also on the war crimes investigation against the head of the Finnish State Police, Arno Anthoni. EHRI has yet to include the archives of the Finnish Ministry of Defence, which have partly been surveyed by the USHMM. Outside the Helsinki-based central archives, the Turku branch of the provincial archives holds the Archives of the Jewish Community of Turku. Six more Finnish provincial archives remain to be surveyed for Holocaust-relevant material.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nEHRI\u2019s identification and description work on Finland was important as there are no third parties known to have carried out systematic surveys so far. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has microfilmed a limited number of sources from the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and from the Finnish Ministry of Defence records. European archival institutions, such as NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam, hold further Holocaust-relevant material on Finland as does the German Bundesarchiv."

The project currently presents two maps: the \u2018Cartographie des enfants juifs de Paris d\u00e9port\u00e9s de juillet 1942 \u00e0 ao\u00fbt 1944\u2019 [Map of Jewish children deported from Paris between July 1942 and August 1944] and the same map covering the whole of France.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of France\u2019s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe central organisation for the conservation and consultation of public archives are the National Archives of France [Archives nationales de France]. They consist of three services at a national level. The first, general one, includes the agency locations in Paris, Fontainebleau and Pierrefitte-sur-Seine. The two others are specialised and decentralised: the National Overseas Archives [Archives nationales d\u2019Outre-Mer] in Aix-en-Provence which include material on the former French colonies, and the National Labour Archives [Archives nationales du monde du travail] in Roubaix. Territorial and municipal archives conserve their own records, as specified in the Heritage Act (articles L. 212-6 and L. 212-6-1). Municipalities with less than 2,000 inhabitants are required to transfer their archives to the Departmental Archives [Archives d\u00e9partementales], unless the prefect decides otherwise. France has 101 Departmental Archives.\r\n\r\nSome organisations are allowed to preserve their own archives, and treat them according to the rules that apply for public archives. The most important ones are the Ministry of Defence [Minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense], the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [Minist\u00e8re des Affaires Etrang\u00e8res], and the Paris Police Headquarters [Pr\u00e9fecture de Police de Paris]. Access to public archives is regulated by the Heritage Act [Code du Patrimoine, plus changes in law 2008-696 of 15 July 2008].

The portal currently contains over 120 repository descriptions, including the National Archives, the Departmental Archives), the archives of the Ministries of Defence, Justice, Foreign Affairs, and several Jewish archives and institutions.\r\n\r\nOne of the , if not the, most important archive on the subject in France, is the M\u00e9morial de la Shoah in Paris. The archive and documentation centre of the M\u00e9morial, the former Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine [CDJC, Centre of Contemporary Jewish Documentation], hold more than 30 million archival documents, including many originals bearing the signature of the heads of the Third Reich and of those responsible for the deportation of the Jews from France. These historical documents are contained in the archive collections listed below, which can be consulted in the reading room of the Documentation Centre. An archival catalogue is available online (not including data relating to the privacy of individuals mentioned). The M\u00e9morial\u2019s collections include German, French and other source collections.\r\n\r\nThe German sources include records from the Headquarters of the Milit\u00e4rbefehlshaber in Frankreich (MBF). The MBF, or German military administration in France, is divided into two major sections:\r\n1. Archives of the military command, which cover the collaboration between the occupation authorities and the P\u00e9tain government in general, the persecution of the Jews and the general reprisal policy;\r\n2. Archives of the administrative command, which include the documents dealing with the control of the occupation authorities over the French economy (interference, spoliations, in particular economic aryanisation). More specifically:\r\n  - The German Embassy in Paris, which was very actively involved in the anti-Jewish measures as can be attested by the numerous telegrams and letters sent several times per day to Berlin by Abetz and Schleier (Plenipotentiary Minister at the German embassy in Paris),\r\n  - The Gestapo in occupied France: the most important group of archives analysed is made up of the records of the Anti-Jewish division of the Gestapo in Paris. This group includes letters, telegrams, and reports on internments, deportations and other measures taken against the Jews, such as wearing the yellow star, rescinding naturalisations as well as general reprisals. There are also documents showing the pressure exerted on Italian policy in their occupied zone. This group also contains documents on the Gestapo in France preserved in the German federal archives [Bundesarchiv Koblenz]. These records give us a true picture of the structures and the activity of the Gestapo in France and in particular in the anti-Jewish division, first led by Dannecker then Rothke.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cArchives of the Nuremberg Trials\u201d contain part of the documentation collected for the investigations of the international military trial as well as the trials conducted by the American military court. For this major group of archives, a specific classification system is used. The main subdivisions are as follows:\r\n- NO (Nazi Organisation): this reference includes the documents from any Nazi organisation, in particular on the role of the S.S., and the WVHA (Central Office of the Economy and the Administration of the S.S.)\r\n- NOKW (Nazi \"Oberkommando der Wehrmacht\"): documents concerning the activities of the German army\r\n- NG (Nazi Government): documents illustrating the activity of the State bodies related to those of the Party\r\n- NI (Nazi Industry): documents related to industry and the financial institutions of the Third Reich\r\n\r\nThe French source collections at the M\u00e9morial include:\r\n- The archives of the General Commissariat for Jewish Questions, or Archives du Commissariat G\u00e9n\u00e9ral aux Questions Juives (CGQJ), with more than 20,000 documents, including the trial proceedings against its leaders\r\n- The archives of Professor Montandon, an ethnologist and \"expert on racial issues\" with the CGQJ. This piecemeal collection covers the period 1924 to 1944 and primarily concerns his ethnological scientific work and his anti-Jewish propaganda activities from 1938 onwards\r\n- The archives of the Institut d'\u00c9tude des Questions Juives, a body created in 1941 under the instigation of Dannecker and of which the M\u00e9morial holds the major portion of the surviving documents. The collection includes the correspondence of the Secretary General and describes all the activities of the Institute\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the archives of the M\u00e9morial contain many other documents, including the Service of the Armistice, the Prefecture of the Police as well as Jewish organisations such as: l'Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants (O.S.E.); les Eclaireurs Isra\u00e9lites de France (E.I.F.); la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Juives de France (F.S.J.F.); Le Conseil Repr\u00e9sentatif des Institutions Juives de France (C.R.I.F.); l'Oeuvre de Protection de L'Enfance Juive (O.P.E.J.); and la Commission Centrale de l'Enfance (C.C.E.). Furthermore, many private collections have been donated to the M\u00e9morial.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the EHRI project, M\u00e9morial de la Shoah was changing its database system. Therefore data integration was not possible in the early stage of the project. Moreover, the descriptive system of the M\u00e9morial was two-fold: a very general description of its holdings on its website and an item description for internal use. Neither of these met EHRI's specifications of top-level collection descriptions. Therefore, M\u00e9morial de la Shoah started by describing the heart of its collections in French and English. All the available metadata have now been integrated into the EHRI portal.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the M\u00e9morial de la Shoah\u2019s collections, EHRI provides descriptions for material at several other archival institutions in France. Namely, the National Archives, which hold administrative records created by several ministries and other central public bodies during the Vichy regime; Vichy and post-war legal proceedings; and documents donated by survivors. The material related to the General Commission on Jewish Affairs [Commissariat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral aux questions juives] is particularly significant. EHRI has also described the closely-related \u2018Archives of the Institute for the Study of Jewish Questions\u2019 [Archives de l\u2019Institut d\u2019\u00e9tude des question juives], which are held by the Defence Historical Service [Service historique de la D\u00e9fense]. Moreover, EHRI provides descriptions for material at the National Archives branch for France\u2019s overseas colonies and the National Audiovisual Institute, which possesses Holocaust-related audiovisual material. Finally, EHRI also provides links from departmental archival institutions to several United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) archival descriptions, which are available as copies at the USHMM.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nThe USHMM holds many copies of many different French archival institutions; Furthermore, the NARA (National Archives and Records Administration) in Maryland/USA possesses all the archives of the U.S. embassy in France from 1936\u20131941 and 1944\u20131953 under \u201cRecords of the Foreign Service Posts of the Department of State.\u201d In Germany, Bundesarchiv holds a number of relevant collections, as does the Politisches Archiv des Ausw\u00e4rtigen Amts and the Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte. In Israel and Russia, Yad Vashem and the RGVA hold records and copies from various organisations and offices in France."

EHRI approach to the United Kingdom: Pre-existing research, archival guides, and expert support**\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom, EHRI has identified, with the support of EHRI partner Wiener Library, a number of online research tools and traditional archival guides:\r\n\r\n- [AIM25](http://www.aim25.ac.uk/)\r\n\r\nAIM25 is a major project that provides electronic access to collection level descriptions of archives from over one hundred higher education institutions, learned societies, cultural organisations and City livery companies within the greater London area. This work is in progress \u2013 new data is being added regularly. EHRI partner Wiener Library is participating in this project.\r\n\r\n- [The Archives Hub](http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/)\r\n\r\nThe Archives Hub is a service funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee. It provides access to descriptions of archival collections held across the UK. At present it covers the descriptions of approximately 200 collection holding institutions. EHRI partner Wiener Library is participating in this project.\r\n\r\n- [Yerusha Portal](https://yerusha.eu/)\r\n\r\nThe Yerusha portal, which incorporates Jewish-related archives around the world and ingests some of the WL\u2019s collections, as well as Southampton, LmA, etc. might be useful to include. Aggregates Jewish archives, not solely focused on the Holocaust\r\n\r\nAmong the traditional archival guides, the following should be mentioned:\r\n- [2000] Wilkinson, Mary & Julie Robertshaw, *Select catalogue of English-language material on the Holocaust held in the department of printed books* (London: Imperial War Museum, Department of Printed Books, 2000),\r\n- [1993] Cantwell, John D., *The Second World War. A guide to documents in the Public Record Office* (London: HMSO, 1993).\r\n\r\nAn important task of the EHRI project in the UK was to include information about the collections held by the Wiener Holocaust Library in the EHRI Portal. Most of the Wiener Holocaust Library collections have descriptions written by the library\u2019s staff. These collection descriptions are included in the Archives Hub mentioned above and have been exported from here to the EHRI Portal.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the British archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe National Archives in London are the official archives for the UK Government, storing its records and those of the United Kingdom\u2019s central courts. The Public Records Act (1958) places responsibility for the management of public records on departments. Additional repositories of The National Archives also exist on the Channel Islands, Jersey and Guernsey. In addition to The National archives, there are many private archive initiatives.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on the United Kingdom**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In the United Kingdom**\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom, EHRI has identified over 20 repositories, and is able to provide over hundreds of archival descriptions from several institutions. The Wiener Holocaust Library is the oldest Holocaust memorial institution in the world. Founded as the Jewish Central Information Office in 1933 by Dr Alfred Wiener, the Library has been based in London since 1939 and holds extensive collections including published and unpublished works, eyewitness accounts, photographs and press cuttings.\r\n\r\nHolocaust-related material, however, is held by many other archival institutions, such as the Island Archives in Guernsey, which hold extensive collections on the German occupation of Guernsey (1940-1945), including those of the Feldkommandantur and the local civil administration, or Jersey Archives, which stores registration cards and significant records of all aspects from the German occupation. In The National Archives, there are very important documents relating to the Second World War and the Holocaust among the British government and military records. The most popular are within departments War Office (WO), Home Office (HO), Prime Minister\u2019s Office Records (PREM) and Foreign Office (FO). The National Archives also holds records of war crimes and criminals (both alleged and proved) from 1939\u20131945 as well as copies of documents captured by the Western Allied forces from enemy powers at the end of the Second World War. Furthermore, the Imperial War Museum in London has collections ranging from film and oral history to works of art and large objects, but also to personal letters and diaries. The Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum as well as the Polish Underground Movement Study Trust hold important Holocaust-related material generated by the Polish government-in-exile as well as the Polish underground in occupied Poland. The collections in the Sikorski Institute are now regarded as holding the most important Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9 collections in the world. An extensive description of the Institute and its holdings can be found in Alina Skibi\u0144ska\u2019s archival guide, which has been revised and translated into English as part of EHRI\u2019s efforts to make Holocaust-relevant sources linked to Poland easier to locate.\r\n\r\nFinally, archives in the UK also house many sources about the Holocaust in other countries, mainly concerning British intelligence on what was happening in occupied Europe as well as the reactions of the governments-in-exile and resistance movements located in the UK.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of the United Kingdom, the United State Memorial Museum, Yad Vashem hold collections that are relevant to Holocaust research on the United Kingdom."

EHRI approach to Greece: Pre-existing research, third-party surveys, available archival guides, and expert support**\r\n\r\nWhen EHRI began its work, a number of studies on the Holocaust in Greece were available, such as Hagen Fleischer\u2019s *Crown and Swastika: Greece during the Occupation and the Resistance, 1941-1944* (1995) and Steven Bowman\u2019s *The Agony of Greek Jews* (2009).

This series is co-published by EHRI-partner Institute for Contemporary History Munich-Berlin [Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte M\u00fcnchen-Berlin, IfZ]. A translation of the series into English under the title *The Persecution and Murder of European Jews by Nazi Germany, 1933\u20131945* is under preparation with the cooperation of Yad Vashem.\r\n\r\nThe GSA has an online catalogue, Arxeiomnimon (2013): http://arxeiomnimon.gak.gr/. Containing some seven million pages of documents it allows navigation through parts of the archival collections originating from 37 GSA agencies (the central service and 36 branches). It should be noted that while the metadata fields are provided in English, the actual descriptions are in Greek. Furthermore, those agencies and materials not included in Arxeiomnimon as of yet are either uncatalogued, or published in Greek-language finding aids or index cards stored in the reading rooms of the respective branches. These published finding aids and index cards, however, are less standardized than the online database.\r\n\r\nThe Hellenic Literary and Historical Archive, better known as E.L.I.A. (part of the National Bank of Greece Cultural Foundation, M.I.E.T.) also has an extensive online Greek language catalogue which meets international metadata standards: http://www.elia.org.gr/ \r\n\r\nAnother useful online resource is the [Database of Greek-Jewish Holocaust Survivors\u2019 Testimonies](http://gjst.ha.uth.gr/en/theproject.php), which has built up a vast collection of audio and visual testimonies from Greek Jews who survived the Holocaust. The database is a virtual archive that systematically brings together testimonies from repositories in Greece and abroad, public and private collections, collected in different languages and places, at different times. \r\nEHRI started its identification and investigation work for data integration on Greece from researcher interviews carried out by the \u201cuser requirements\u201d for the project. By linking data integration and user requirements, EHRI aims to ensure that the EHRI Portal will attract historians, archivists, and the general public, and that it identifies the data that researchers hope to find on the EHRI Portal, in order to generate more interest and offer more meaningful content and format. Researchers of the Holocaust in Greece interviewed by EHRI were asked to suggest further researchers specialized in Holocaust history in Greece to participate in an EHRI workshop on data integration and Holocaust research in Greece, which took place in December 2012. Four representatives of archival institutions in Greece, three graduate students, two junior and two senior researchers participated in the workshop.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the workshop was to receive expert feedback on this list and further complete EHRI\u2019s overview of the archival institutions and identify Holocaust-related collections within the institutions. EHRI also needed to better understand the format of the metadata and detect where further surveying was necessary. The overall goal was to create a state-of-the-art report of identified Holocaust-related sources in Greece and to add this information to the EHRI portal, as much as possible via the technical Work Packages (as opposed to manually entering the information into the portal).\r\n\r\nThe Greek workshop has had multiple benefits for EHRI as it has helped ensure that the content fits the user. It was a time-efficient identification method which avoided duplication of work. At the same time, it was an investment in smooth communication with future Portal users. We found that the EHRI Portal can support Holocaust-research in Greece by improving access to information about the materials, be it awareness about and location of repositories or identifying relevant collections within repositories. Engaging with the research community can help EHRI further enrich the data by annotating and adding it to the portal. A second important role for EHRI can be to reach out to the institutions and offer them tools and a platform to share the information about their holdings to the research community.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Greek archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nA major challenge in Greece is that there are an unknown number of materials which remain largely invisible. As a consequence, there is no indication about their existence online and there is a huge (digital) description backlog, which requires thorough identifying and inventorying. As a consequence, uncatalogued materials remain hidden.\r\n\r\nFinding aids are often only consultable at the repository itself. The limited amount of online information and locally available cataloguing systems make access to the physical materials time consuming, often costly, and inefficient (a research trip is hard to prepare).\r\n\r\nAnother challenge concerns receiving permission for consultation. Access to public archives in Greece often requires an application procedure before any access is granted. Two laws regulate the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal and sensitive archives (1991 and 1997). The time limit for keeping records restricted was reduced from fifty to thirty years (although there is room for flexibility in certain cases). In some cases it is not possible or there are limits to taking photographs as well as making scans or photocopies. Sometimes, a reading room\u2019s lack of capacity can be an issue.\r\n\r\nAt the Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, not all archives can be made publicly accessible for reasons of national security, among others. Moreover, there has been at least one case where a collection of documents concerning the Holocaust was removed from the original collections and was put in one separate collection, leading to a loss of context.\r\n\r\nAnother issue pertains to the destruction of archives. The destruction of archives does not only apply to Holocaust archives, but has included sources Holocaust-related sources. For example, the archives of the Greek Agency for War Crimes, which was founded in the autumn of 1945, were totally destroyed in 1975. In some cases, materials have been scanned before destruction. The Jewish Community of Thessaloniki, which engages in such digitization projects, has preserved certain sources in this way. \r\n\r\nYet another challenge is that material is in the possession of private organisations which do not necessarily consider themselves archival institutions. These archives are hard to locate and often remain \u201chidden treasures\u201d. Being able to share the knowledge on the mere existence of these hidden treasures by entering or annotating them to the EHRI portal could already be a major step forward for Greek Holocaust research, especially at the local level, in Jewish community archives.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Greece**\r\n\r\nIn Greece, EHRI identified 43 Holocaust-relevant repositories, and was able to present 96 archival descriptions by December 2018. While many archival institutions can be found, predictably, in the country\u2019s capital, Athens, important collections are also held by regional branches of the General State Archives (GSA), especially in Greece\u2019s northern regions, i.e. in Central Macedonia, as well as in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace.\r\n\r\nThe largest institution for EHRI\u2019s purposes in Greece, the General State Archives (National Archives of Greece, GSA), are the national institution responsible for the preservation and promotion of the Greek archival materials. The institution was created in 1914 and its operation is organized by law. The Greek State Archives consist of a central service, 47 regional services and 16 local archives. Based on the location of the wartime Jewish communities in Greece \u2013 in at least 27 cities according to the Central Board of Jewish Communities of Greece (2009) \u2013 researchers will have to visit different GSA branches if they wish to consult archives relating to particular communities. It is also important to keep in mind that a large amount of the material in the GSA remains non-digital and not all the digitized materials have been included in Arxeiomnimon yet.\r\n\r\nIn March 2008, all branches of the GSA were asked to provide an overview of collections and documents related to the history of the Jews in Greece and the Holocaust in order to prepare the survey work of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM). The responses were rather limited: fifteen to twenty local offices submitted such a report, which varied from a short note confirming there is such material available to an overview of records. These overviews have served as orientation tools for EHRI\u2019s work in Greece. \r\n\r\nBeyond the GSA\u2019s collections, the Jewish Museum of Greece (JMG) conserves more than 2,000 artefacts, including books and pamphlets, periodicals, maps, documents, manuscripts (personal notes, correspondence, memoires, diaries, etc.), false IDs, personal objects, ritual objects, jewellery, textiles and costumes, clothing, badges, armbands, numismatics (coins, banknotes, stock certificates) and an art collection. The JMG\u2019s Holocaust archive includes records of the Central Agency for the Custody of Jewish Property (the Ypiresias Diacheirisis Israilitikon Periousion, Y.D.I.P. archive), the \u039f.\u03a0.\u0391.\u0399.\u0395 archive (O.P.A.I.E., the Heirless Property and Jewish Rehabilitation Fund), private and personal archives which include material pertinent to the Shoah, the JMG Archive of Oral Testimonies and a Photographic Archive. The JMG\u2019s Holocaust Photographic Archive has a rich and expanding collection of photographic images spanning from the pre-war period to the early 1950s. The broad subject areas, each including several subcategories, capture Jewish life before, during and after the Second World War and the Holocaust. An extensive number of document scans and photographs of the museum\u2019s collection have been uploaded in Judaica Europeana.\r\n\r\nWhile EHRI has identified a considerable number of archives and institutions with Holocaust-relevant collections, many others are yet to be located. For example, the location of the Police and Army Archives remains unknown. The same goes for sources relating to two concentration camps in Greece where Jews were imprisoned. Archival documentation on their presence is missing. In other cases, EHRI is aware of the existence of archives that are likely to hold Holocaust-related materials, but is yet to ascertain the significance of their collections. Archives and institutions that fall under this category include: the Chamber of Commerce, the Court House and other juridical archives; municipal archives; church archives (for example: the archives of the Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church); Communist Party Archives; Red Cross Archives; public and private company archives (electricity, water, port companies); and private collections kept in museums, at home, or in private institutions. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the identification of the relevant repositories, EHRI has also found that certain archives, which were originally thought to hold Holocaust-related materials, do not in fact have such material. For example, it was found that not all municipal archives of cities with a Jewish community during the Second World War, had kept their collections, but had transferred them to local GSA branches.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Greece, archives and collections relevant to the period of the Holocaust in Greece can be found in a number of countries, some of which are partially covered by Holocaust-relevant archival guides. For Germany, for instance, there is Irith Dublon-Knebel\u2019s overview *German Foreign Office Documents on the Holocaust in Greece* (2007), while for Italy, there are collections of documents edited by Daniel Carpi, *Italian Diplomatic Documents on the History of the Holocaust in Greece* (1941-1943), Tel Aviv, Diaspora Research Center-Tel Aviv University, 1999.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, relevant archival holdings are located at the Political Archive of the German Foreign Office in Berlin, the Federal Archives-Department Military Archives in Freiburg, the Federal Archives-The Central Office for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes in Lundwigsburg, and the Arolsen Archives. Finally, in Bulgaria archival holdings can be found at the Central State Archives in Sofia and the Central Military Archives in Veliko Turnovo.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, relevant archival holdings are located at the National Archives in Washington DC, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC, the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York, the Visual History Archive/USC Shoah Foundation in Los Angeles, the American Joint Distribution Committee Archives in New York, and the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Sterling Memorial Library (Yale University). A special note needs to be made about copies of the archives of the following Greek Jewish communities which were copied and made available for research at USHMM, but remain largely inaccessible for research in Greece itself for various reasons (including lack of resources). USHMM has completed its digitization in Larissa and Chalkida; digitization has been started in Volos, Ioannina, and Trikala; digitization may continue in Athens, Corfu and Rhodes.\r\n\r\nIn Israel, relevant archival holdings are located at the Yad Vashem Archives in Jerusalem, the Central Zionist Archives in Jerusalem, the Hagana History Archives in Tel Aviv, the Ghetto Fighters\u2019 House Archives in Galilee, and the Institute of Contemporary Jewry, Oral History Division (Hebrew University).\r\n\r\nIn England, relevant archival holdings are located at the National Archives in Kew; in Spain, at the Archives of the Spanish Foreign Office in Madrid; in Switzerland, at the International Committee of the Red Cross Archives in Geneva; and in Austria, at the Central Europe Center for Research and Documentation (known as Centropa) in Vienna."

Kompleks usta\u0161kih logora 1941, I\u2013II (2007); Vladimir Geiger / Martina Grahek Ravan\u010di\u0107 / Marica Karaka\u0161 Obradov (eds.) *Logori, zatvori i prisilni rad u Hrvatskoj/Jugoslaviji 1941\u20131945, 1945\u20131951* (2010); Alexander Korb\u2019s *Im Schatten des Weltkriegs: Massengewalt der Ustasa gegen Serben, Juden und Roma in Kroatien 1941\u20131945* (2013); Marica Karaka\u0161 Obradov, \u201cPrisilne migracije \u017eidovskog stanovni\u0161tva na podru\u010dju Nezavisne Dr\u017eave Hrvatske\u201d, *Croatica Christiana periodica* 37:72 (2013); Marica Karaka\u0161 Obradov, \u201cIseljavanje \u017didova iz Hrvatske nakon Drugoga svjetskog rata\u201d, Historijski zbornik 66:2 (2013); Ivo Goldstein, Jasenovac (2018); Zdravko Dizdar, *Logor Danica u Koprivnici* 1941\u20131942, 1\u20133, (2017 \u2013 2020); Naida-Michal Brandl, *\u017didovi u hrvatskoj nakon Holokausta* (2023). \r\n\r\nAs a result, a number of useful finding aids were identified. Online search tools are provided by both the Croatian State Archives and the National and University Library:\r\n- Hrvatski arhivski informacijski sustav / Croatian archival information system (https://hais.arhiv.hr/HDA/) \r\n- Biblionet (http://biblionet.arhiv.hr/)\r\n- The National and University Library (https://www.nsk.hr)\r\n\r\nA more traditional guide with general information about archives in Croatia is Igor Karaman\u2019s *Studije i prilozi iz arhivistike* (Zagreb: Arhiv Hrvatske, 1993).\r\n\r\nFor a general guide on archival holdings in the Republic of Croatia see Vida Pavli\u010dek, \u201cPregled arhivskih fondova i zbirki Republike Hrvatske. Rad na prikupljanju i obradi podataka\u201d, Arhivski vjesnik 50:1 (2007): 9\u201332. Regarding the archival material on the Holocaust, Josip Kolanovi\u0107 published a paper \u201cHolocaust in Croatia \u2013 Documentation and research perspectives\u201d Arhivski vjesnik 39 (1996): 157\u2013174 and in 2013, the Croatian State Archives published an online paper presenting Holocaust-relevant collections (http://zagreb.arhiv.hr/hr/teme/holokaust.htm). It should also be noted that most collections in the Croatian State Archive and other state archives throughout the country have their own finding aids with descriptions of what can be found in which box of an entire collection. Some collections are better explored than others, often depending on the interests of archivists who use the collections for PhD theses or other post-doc works. However, they are available only in the archives themselves, and not online. General Guide for Archival Holdings in Republic of Croatia (Pregled arhivskih fondova i zbirki Republike Hrvatske, Zagreb: Hrvatski dr\u017eavni arhiv, 2006\u20132007) is contemporary Croatian archives service obligatory finding aid, which provides basic data on archival holdings in Republic of Croatia in custody of archival, but also of non-archival institutions. It does not, however, single out \u201cHolocaust\u201d as a keyword. Its latest edition (2006) is not available in pdf.\r\n\r\nAs for surveys by third parties the USHMM has been intermittently active in Croatia since the late 1990s (Sporazum o suradnji izme\u0111u \u201cUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum-a\u201d i Hrvatskog drz\u030cavnog arhiva. Bulletin. Hrvatski drz\u030cavni arhiv (Zagreb). 6:1\u20132 (1995): 17\u201318). During the 1990s, local experts surveyed and copied war-time material at the Zagreb State Archives. It leads an endeavor to digitalise material from other state archives in the country and pre-war records from Zagreb. The USHMM is also helping the Jewish Community in Zagreb archive to sort its material, which will later be digitalised. The microfilmed collections from the Second World War (surveyed in the 1990s), plus scanned material from the interwar period and the Second World War (ongoing survey) from different repositories around the country is gradually being put online. The work on the identification of the post-war material is in progress.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Croatian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAll collections are usually accessible to the public, but if a file refers to a person who was born less than 100 years ago, it will not be possible to copy that file. Each archival director is responsible for the approval of requests to scan or copy specific material submitted by individual research projects rather than through a more global agreement between institutions.\r\n\r\nAlthough important online search tools are available, they are of limited use for Holocaust scholars. Furthermore, keywords such as \u201cJewish\u201d or \u201cHolocaust\u201d will not produce many results in these online search databases. Some collection descriptions on HAIS mention that \u201cpart of the material was copied for the needs of USHMM\u201d (but typing \u201cUSHMM\u201d into the search box will not lead one to collections copied for the USHMM).\r\n\r\nKnowledge of regional history, on how institutions were organized, and of who (or which political body) was in charge at given dates in time is essential to find relevant information within the body of archival material. In some cases, there is a high probability of identifying Holocaust-relevant files, but often it is more like \u201cfinding a needle in a haystack\u201d. Researchers need to rely on assistance from local archivists to identify or at least narrow down the search for relevant information to a number of collections. However, this can still leave one with hundreds of boxes to consult without any firm indication of what they may contain.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Croatia**\r\n\r\n**C. I. In Croatia**\r\n\r\nEHRI identified and investigated Holocaust-relevant archival institutions and collections in Croatia in close cooperation with USHMM and Yad Vashem. The Croatian State Archive in Zagreb and the State Archive of the City of Zagreb are of particular importance. Two other state archives, in Osijek (a city with the second largest Jewish community in Croatia) and Rijeka (Fiume in Italian), a city in the northern Adriatic are equally important. These two archives are regional centres; Osijek has a rich Jewish history and was home to the second largest Jewish community in Croatia and during the Second World War the border town of Rijeka received thousands of Jewish refugees who had escaped To Italian held areas in NDH, or to the Italian territory. Three other cities with state archives and a relatively rich Jewish history are Vara\u017edin, in the north, Slavonski Brod, which also has a relatively strong and as yet under-researched Jewish heritage, and Split, on the southern coast. Until the 19th century, Split\u2019s Jewish community mostly consisted of Sephardic Jews, but this community also had roots dating back to the Roman period.\r\n\r\nApart from the State Archives, other important collection-holding institutions are the National and University Library in Zagreb (which stores interwar Jewish periodicals, some of which were published until April/May 1941), and the library and archive of the Jewish community center in Zagreb. At the time of writing, the latter is not yet open to the public as it is awaiting archival renovation and the sorting of its archival material into collections. There are smaller Jewish community archives in other Croatian cities and towns, which do not function as public institutions. One needs to first contact somebody from the local Jewish community to find out where they are and if their holdings can be consulted. However, the majority of archival collections of different Jewish communities in Croatia are held in the Jewish Historical Museum in Belgrade, Serbia.\r\n\r\nOther relevant institutions for Holocaust research in Croatia include the Documentation Center for Holocaust Victims and Survivors (CENDO), the Jasenovac Memorial and the Croatian History Museum of Croatia in Zagreb. The latter reported that they have some possibly interesting material concerning Croatian Jewish families within the Documentation and Information Department, and in the Photography department. However, the museum is under-staffed, so the archives have not been completely sorted and are not recognized as \u201cHolocaust material\u201d even though many of the families whose lives are documented perished during the war. The museum would like to see these materials labelled as Holocaust-related in the future. A similar situation applies to the Brod Regional Museum [Muzej Brodskog Posavlja] in Slavonski Brod.\r\n\r\nThe Archdiocesan Archives are now a part of the Croatian State Archive system, but some collections are held in a separate location within the church. Therefore, it has been added as a separate institution.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the USHMM and Yad Vashem, EHRI has yet to determine which archival institutions and collections outside of Croatia are relevant to Holocaust research on Croatia. Due to the fact that the territory of the NDH incorporated territory of the Eastern Srijem that s today\u2019s Serbia as well as the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, some archives and museums in NW Serbia as well as those in Bosnia and Herzegovina, for example Banja Luka, Tuzla, Sarajevo, etc. have some documents relevant to Croatia. The Military Archives in Belgrade probably has archival collections relevant to the Holocaust in Croatia due to the fact that it still holds archival collections of the NDH and the Archives of Yugoslavia in Belgrade, is likely to hold relevant collections."

EHRI approach to Hungary: Pre-existing research and third-party surveys**\r\n\r\nThe first large-scale survey of Holocaust-related archival records in Hungary was launched in the late 1950s and early 1960s and was conducted by Elek Karsai and his associates on behalf of the National Agency of Hungarian Israelites (MIOK). It resulted in the publication of a three volume series \u2013 Benoschofsky Ilona, Karsai Elek (eds.), *V\u00e1dirat a n\u00e1cizmus ellen. Dokumentumok a magyarorsz\u00e1gi zsid\u00f3\u00fcld\u00f6z\u00e9s t\u00f6rt\u00e9net\u00e9hez* 3 vols., Budapest: Magyar Izraelit\u00e1k Orsz\u00e1gos K\u00e9pviselete, Kiad\u00f3i f\u00e9lv\u00e1szonk\u00f6t\u00e9sben 1958-1967 \u2013 and a broad selection of documents known as \u201cSeries I\u201d were made available on 180 microfilms in the Hungarian National Archives, Yad Vashem and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. In 1994, a follow-up project was launched by \u00c1gnes S\u00e1gv\u00e1ri, which resulted in the creation of minor collections of selected Holocaust records in all the municipal (county) archives in Hungary, as well as a series of source publications. In 1993, a research guide to archival materials relevant for Jewish studies in Hungary (including some Holocaust-related parts as well) was published: Gy\u00f6rgy Haraszti and G\u00e9za Komor\u00f3czy (eds), *Magyar zsid\u00f3 lev\u00e9lt\u00e1ri repert\u00f3rium* [*Hungarian Jewish Archival Guide*] Vols. 1-2. Budapest: MTA Judaisztikai Kutat\u00f3csoport, 1993. Due to the re-organisation of the material, merging archives, newly found or added records and several other reasons, the information provided by this guide has remained incomplete, requiring updates and corrections.\r\n\r\nThe finding aids and descriptions available at archives in Hungary tend to provide scholars specialised in Holocaust Studies with little specific information. With the sole exception of the Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives, none of the archives in Hungary provide visitors with detailed finding aids in English. Only some offer online collection descriptions, but in most cases only a general overview of the holdings is available online. However, many institutions have launched digitisation projects and there is an increasing number of online finding aids.\r\n\r\nThe research teams of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Yad Vashem Archives have conducted extensive research in the previous two decades in Hungary. They prepared detailed collection-level and file-level descriptions for institutions of particular importance to Holocaust research, including the Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives, the National Archives of Hungary, the Budapest Municipal Archives, the Historical Archives of the State Security and the Institute and Museum of Military History.\r\n\r\nThe most recent major comprehensive documentary account on the topic in English is *The Holocaust in Hungary. Evolution of a Genocide* by Zolt\u00e1n V\u00e1gi, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Cs\u0151sz and G\u00e1bor K\u00e1d\u00e1r (Washington, DC: AltaMira Press-USHMM, 2013). The volume offers a selection of archival material from various archives in Hungary and abroad. The most relevant archival sources, especially on the history of the ghettoisation and deportation in 1944 are summarised in the entries of Randolph L. Braham (ed.), *Geographical Encyclopedia of the Holocaust in Hungary* (Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern University Press, 2013). \r\n\r\nEHRI\u2019s experts on Hungary have made good use of the online finding aids on the microfilmed Hungarian records available on the USHMM website as well as of the valuable survey material we have obtained from colleagues at the Yad Vashem Archives. In addition, they have consulted archivists of the key collection-holding institutes.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Hungarian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAccording to the Act on public records, public archives and the protection of private archival holdings (in short: Archives Act, Act LXVI of 1995), public archives in Hungary were divided into national (general) archives, specialised state archives, municipal (city and county) archives, archives of public foundations and other public bodies, as well as private archives open to the public. The Public Records Act was modified by Act LXI of 2012, which brought about fundamental changes in the archival system. The Hungarian National Archives [Magyar Orsz\u00e1gos Lev\u00e9lt\u00e1r], the central repository holding collections transferred from national government bodies as well as all county and most of the city archives, were integrated on 1 October 2012 into the newly established National Archives of Hungary [Magyar Nemzeti Lev\u00e9lt\u00e1r], a centralised, state-controlled body. A few municipal archives have not been merged into these new central archives, including the Budapest Municipal Archives. In addition, there are several specialised archives, some 20 church and 20 Jewish community archives as well as other collection-holding institutions, including about 25 museums, major Budapest libraries, and private collections that hold records relevant for Holocaust research.\r\n\r\nIn Hungary, any person may, upon preliminary application, be granted free access to archival records held in public archives. Access to public records preserved in the National Archives of Hungary and its branch institutions are regulated by the Archives Act and its modifications since then (Amendment CXL of 1997. Enacting Clauses 19 and 20/1198. MKM), the Data Protection Act (LXIII of 1992) and the Privacy Act (LXV of 1995). One of the most important regulations concerning personal data of an individual mentioned in the records is that these data must not be published sooner than 30 years following the death of the person concerned, or if the year of death is unknown, for 90 years following the birth of the person concerned, or if both dates are unknown, for 60 years following the date of issue of the archival material concerned. \u201cPersonal data\u201d is defined as any data that can be related to a certain natural person (\u201cperson concerned\u201d) and any conclusion that can be drawn from such data about the person concerned.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Hungary**\r\n\r\n**C. I. In Hungary**\r\n\r\nIn Hungary, EHRI has so far identified a significant number of archival institutions, which are relevant for Holocaust research. EHRI has carried out archival descriptions in several of them: the Budapest-based Hungarian National Archives, the Budapest Municipal Archives, the Historical Archives of the Hungarian State Security, the Military History Archives, the Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives; the Holocaust Memorial Center; and the Pest County Archives.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nArchival sources pertaining to the Holocaust in Hungary can be found in the archives of all seven neighbouring countries (Austria, Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia) as well as in other foreign countries, most importantly Germany, Israel and the United States. Key foreign archives holding material pertaining to the Holocaust in Hungary include the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Archives, the Yad Vashem Archives, the Bundesarchiv, and the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington DC. While most records are written in Hungarian, finding aids and working languages differ in all these places. This continues to pose a serious challenge to researchers. Consequently, the identification and investigation of these archival documents require extensive international cooperation.\r\n"

EHRI approach to Israel: Pre-existing research and third-party surveys, archival guides and expert support**\r\n\r\nIn Israel, EHRI was able to rely on and cooperate with Israel Archives Network, or RE'I Project of the National Library and State Archives in Israel which in 2013 conducted a survey, under the auspices of the Prime Minister's Office, to identify and map most archives in Israel. In the process, information was collected on archives holding Holocaust-related material, as well as on the documentation itself. The RE'I Project aimed at building an infrastructure, creating uniform standards for the archives in Israel, ensuring proper maintenance of documentation in various archives in Israel, and granting easy archival access to the public in Israel.\r\n\r\nThe RE\u2019I Project has established that there are some 600 archives in Israel. Whether they hold Holocaust-relevant sources, and to what extent, was largely unknown before.\r\n\r\nIn the first implementation stage of the RE\u2019I Project, a survey was conducted in all the archives that had been designated by the project steering committee. Surveyors were recruited to visit the various archives and to conduct an online survey via a dedicated survey system provided by Ransys Feedback Technologies. The survey was conducted over the course of a year. At the start of the survey, a list of 350 archives was available.\r\n\r\nCooperation between EHRI and RE'I, which was facilitated by Yad Vashem and started in the planning stages of the survey, allowed for the insertion of questions relating to the existence of Holocaust-related materials in the archives to be surveyed. The questions were designed to ascertain whether or not any Holocaust-related documentation existed in a particular archive; the nature of the documentation (personal documents, official documents, testimonies, memoirs); and the number of relevant collections in the archive. Likewise, the archives were asked to briefly describe the relevant collections and to provide their signatures.\r\n\r\nAbout 200 of the archives surveyed responded that they had Holocaust-related documentation. A large number of the archives also mentioned the types of existing documentation in their possession. Only a few, however, responded to questions regarding the number of relevant collections and their signatures. It appears that the reason for this is that many of the archives in Israel do not use the practice of registering documentation at the collection level, but rather at the file level. Another reason is the fact that some of the documentation is dispersed in files or collections pertaining to other topics. This hinders the identification and description of the documentation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, most of the relevant information gained from the RE'I survey pertains to the identification of Israeli archives holding various types of Holocaust-related material. In some cases there is also a very general description of the documentation. For the most part, it is difficult to extract quantitative data, collection signatures or detailed descriptions from the survey. Some of the archives are already included in the EHRI portal. More detailed information on the documentation in some of the archives, and its inclusion in the EHRI portal, will be possible once the archives become accessible in the framework of the RE'I project and the data is imported.\r\n\r\nBelow are examples of data provided by archives that participated in the survey, regarding Holocaust-related documentation in their possession. These examples represent the various types of archives in Israel: municipal or community archives \u2013 cities, communal settlements (moshavim), kibbutzim; archives of public and private organisations, institutions and political parties; and archives dedicated to a specific topic.\r\n\r\nMoshav and kibbutz archives primarily hold personal documentation of past and present members, refugees and Holocaust survivors, which is often kept in their personal files. The most prevalent types of documentation in these archives are testimonies and memoirs. Some of the archives have reported that the relevant material is scattered among various files and difficult to identify.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that some of the kibbutz and moshav members and some of the archives in these locations have submitted the originals or copies of the documentation in their possession to archives that primarily collect Holocaust-related documentation, such as Lohamei Haghetaot, Yad Ya'ari, Masuah and Moreshet. For example, the Yad Vashem Archives contain record group O.90 which includes documentation collected from kibbutzim. Since the survey did not include a question relating to original vs. copied documentation, it is difficult to say how much of the documentation is original. It should also be noted that some of the archives included information on Holocaust commemoration in their reports on Holocaust-related documentation.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- Kibbutz Beit Hashita archive \u2013 50 items. Testimonies of survivors and orphans adopted by the kibbutz. There is also material on the absorption of youth groups and groups that were trained in the kibbutz and went on to establish other kibbutzim.\r\n- Kfar Yehoshua archive \u2013 requests for certificates; documentation of the youth groups that arrived from Germany and Romania, documentation in members' personal files.\r\n- Kibbutz Hafetz Haim archive \u2013 16 files. Testimonies of kibbutz members, most of whom were Holocaust survivors.\r\n- Kibbutz Mayanot archive \u2013 25 testimonies; letters of Yosef Kaplan, Shomer Hatzair emissary in Warsaw, who perished in the Holocaust and who corresponded with kibbutz members; documentation on Haviva Reich and other kibbutz members.\r\n- Kibbutz Hatzerim archive \u2013 60 items. File on the Teheran children; information on kibbutz members who were Holocaust survivors.\r\n- Yad Ya'ari Hashomer Hatzair Archive \u2013 about 20 collections, including Hashomer Hatzair in Poland; Hashomer Hatzair in Yugoslavia; the bureau in Paris; Hashomer Hatzair worldwide; personal collections of Abba Kovner, Shalom Cholawski, Chaika Grossman, the sculptor Nathan Rapoport.\r\n- Machon Lavon Labor Movement Archive \u2013 2 collections. The Hehalutz liaison office in Geneva - Nathan Schwalb (Dror) archive; collection of certificates from the Holocaust period.\r\n- Maccabee Archive \u2013 personal stories of athletes from Vilna who were banned from the 1936 Olympics by the Nazi regime.\r\n- Yad Chaim Weizmann Archive \u2013 correspondence regarding requests for rescue and aid and memos describing the situation of the Jews in Europe.\r\n- Felicia Blumental Music Center archive \u2013 Huberman archive: personal correspondence of Bronislaw Huberman regarding the Nazi rise to power in Germany in the framework of a pan-European movement and correspondence with the conductor Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler regarding the banishment of Jews from cultural life in Germany due to the antisemitic policies of the Nazis.\r\n- Leo Baeck Institute for the Study of German and Central European Jewry archive \u2013 unknown number of unique and rare letters, diaries and personal testimonies from the Holocaust period.\r\n- Hebrew University archive \u2013 There is not an exact number of items. Pre-war acceptance applications from individuals who anticipated the future and attempted to escape from Europe; diplomas awarded to students; documentation of project \"Treasures of the Diaspora\": campaign to salvage materials during the war, especially towards its end in 1945 and afterwards, when it was possible to move freely in those areas. The university sent missions to salvage materials, books and archives of Jewish communities in Europe. The administrative documentation that was produced during the campaign is found in the archive and the materials themselves are today in the National Library and the Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Israeli archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nMany archives in Israel contain a great deal of personal documentation, created or preserved by victims and survivors of the Holocaust, which reflects their experiences. Refugees and survivors had or have a variety of personal papers in their possession which reflect their experiences before, during and after the Shoah. They also document their histories and the events they witnessed in their former places of residence in Europe. A large portion of this material has been deposited and new material continues to arrive at various archives throughout Israel.\r\n\r\nAn increasing awareness of the great importance of Holocaust-era personal documentation held by private individuals in Israel has led the archives of Yad Vashem and the Ghetto Fighters' House in recent years to appeal to the Israeli public to deposit such documentation in their archives. These campaigns have resulted in the addition of thousands of items, mostly original documents, to the archives' collections.\r\n\r\nThe Yad Vashem Law, enacted by the Israeli Parliament in 1953, defined the institution\u2019s mission as \u201cto collect, examine and publish testimony of the disaster and the heroism it called forth\u2026\u201d, thus commemorating the Shoah and its victims. As a result, the Yad Vashem Archives were established which have collected Holocaust-related documentation from various sources ever since. However, efforts to document the Holocaust had begun long before 1953. From the Nazi rise to power in Germany, and throughout the Second World War, people documented the events as they were taking place, often under the harshest conditions. Even before the enormity of the disaster became clear, Mordechai Shenhavi initiated a Commemorative Project for the Jews of Europe that would include an archive. The Yad Vashem Archives officially started operating in 1946, under the direction of Dr. Sarah Friedlander, who had been born in Budapest and saved on the Kasztner train. The first documents arrived at Yad Vashem from the \u201cHistorical Commissions\u201d and various documentation centres, as well as public institutions, researchers and private individuals. Material collected in Israel was added to the documentation collected by Jews during the war in the ghettos, camps and hideaways. Immediately after the war, centres for documentation and the collection of testimonies were established in many places around the world, including Munich, Warsaw, Lodz, Lublin, Paris, Bratislava, Budapest and other locations.\r\n\r\nSince their establishment, the Yad Vashem Archives have initiated activities with a view to collecting and copying Holocaust-related documents that have been housed in various archives in Europe and throughout the world. With the fall of the \u201cIron Curtain\u201d and the opening of archives in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s, the reproduction project has been greatly expanded.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results in Israel**\r\n\r\nAfter decades of collecting Holocaust-relevant sources and original research in the field, Yad Vashem is clearly the most important record-holding institution in Israel. With over 210,000,000 pages of documentation it stores the largest collection of Holocaust documents in the world. The collections include over 131,000 survivor testimonies; over 500,000 photographs and approximately 4.8 million names registered in the Hall of Names.\r\n\r\nIt was crucial to include collection data held by Yad Vashem in the EHRI portal. In EHRI\u2019s first phase, It was decided to divide the work into two steps. In the first step, descriptions of record groups and sub-record groups existing in the Yad Vashem database were manually added to the EHRI portal. Alongside the addition of the descriptions to the portal, dozens of authority entries were developed \u2013 especially personalities and organizations \u2013 which were later linked to the appropriate collection descriptions. In the second step, we added about 47 record groups and sub-record groups comprising 11,000 units of description in an IT-driven integration process.\r\n\r\nIn EHRI\u2019s second phase, the export activity of Yad Vashem had two goals. Firstly, EHRI wanted to update Yad Vashem\u2019s existing content on the EHRI portal, improve the quality of the descriptions and add new records. Secondly, the goal was to have a sustainable connection between Yad Vashem and the EHRI portal, allowing content updates and additions of new material on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, an additional 45 record groups, which have an internal hierarchical structure, have been exported to the portal. There were several challenges in the export process, including the definition of the export structure and standardization of the data; development of new workflows while bearing in mind that they should be designed to allow automatization in the future; and the creation of a new service in the Yad Vashem digital infrastructure for publishing data in a sustainable way.\r\n\r\nThe team used the EAD conversion tool provided by EHRI to create the EAD files as it allows for the creation of the EADs in a way which is consistent with the constraints requested by the EHRI project.\r\n\r\nThe EAD records were published using the Metadata Publication Tool provided by EHRI. This tool allows exposure of the EAD records for harvesting. The export was done in two languages, Hebrew and English, and is available in the portal. During EHRI-3, and following the changes to the data integration infrastructure introduced during this phase, the data exchange workflow was further sustained by the development of a bespoke API by YV, ensuring future updates of their archival descriptions. More than 1,400 additional record groups have been exported to the portal. Currently, the record groups are being linked to the corresponding record groups in other institutions present on the EHRI portal, since most of these record groups are copied collections acquired by the Yad Vashem archive.  \r\n\r\nApart from Yad Vashem there are many other repositories in Israel that hold Holocaust-related documentation and collect materials on this subject. Such archives include (in a non-exhaustive fashion):\r\n\r\n*American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, Jerusalem Branch*\r\n\r\nFounded during the First World War, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) was the first Jewish organisation in the United States to dispense large-scale funding for international relief. In its wake, the First World War had sown the seeds of many additional catastrophes\u2014pogroms, epidemics, famine, revolution, and economic ruin\u2014and JDC played a major role in rebuilding the devastated communities of Eastern Europe and Mandatory Palestine. JDC\u2019s relief activities, emigration aid, and rescue operations critically followed the Nazi rise to power and the outbreak of the Second World War. After the war, JDC supported and resettled survivors and help rebuild the remnant Jewish communities of Europe. The JDC Archives house one of the most significant collections in the world for the study of modern Jewish history. The JDC Archives are located in two centres, one at JDC\u2019s New York headquarters and the second in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n*Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People*\r\n\r\nThe Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People (CAHJP), established in 1939, is now a subsidiary of the National Library of Israel. This archive includes millions of pages of original and copied documentation related to Jewish communities, including information about those communities before, during, and after World War II. For instance, they hold 1,600 archives of hundreds of Jewish communities, local, national and international Jewish organisations and private collections of many outstanding Jewish personalities. Today, this archive contains the most extensive collection of documents, pinkassim (registers) and other records of Jewish history from the Middle Ages to the present day.\r\n\r\n*Central Zionist Archives*\r\n\r\nThe Zionist Archives were founded in 1919 in Berlin. With the rise to power of the Nazis in 1933, the Archives were transferred to the Jewish Agency building in Jerusalem. Over the years, the collections expanded and after the Second World War an increased effort was made to bring the scarce archival material that had survived the war to Israel. In 1956, the 24th Zionist Congress declared the Central Zionist Archives to be the historic archives of the Zionist Movement, of the World Zionist Organization and of the Jewish Agency. The Central Zionist Archives act as the historic archives of the World Zionist Organization, the Jewish Agency, the Jewish National Fund, the United Israel Appeal and the World Jewish Congress. In addition, they hold archives of organisations and institutions of the Jewish population in the Land of Israel, as well as 1,500 personal archives, including on the heads and leaders of the Zionist Movement and the national funds and various personalities who have been active in the Zionist movement.\r\n\r\n*Ganzach Kiddush Hashem Archive*\r\n\r\nThe Kiddush Hashem Archive (in Hebrew, Ganzach Kiddush Hashem), an Orthodoxy-affiliated Holocaust institution, was founded in 1964 by the Holocaust researcher Rabbi Moshe Prager \"with the aim of commemorating the destroyed Jewish world, the heroism of the Jewish soul during the Holocaust, and the miracle of the Jewish People\u2019s rebirth in Israel\". For 60 years the archive has gathered about 300,000 photographs in the Photograph Archive, about 2,000,000 documents in the Document Archive, approximately 40,000 textbooks in the Library as well as about 2000 video testimonies.\r\n\r\n*Ghetto Fighters' House*\r\n\r\nThe Ghetto Fighters' House \u2013 Itzhak Katzenelson Holocaust and Jewish Resistance Heritage Museum, an institution historically affiliated with the Zionist Labour movement, was founded in 1949 by a community of Holocaust survivors, members of the Jewish underground in the ghettos of Poland, and veterans of partisan units, to be a place of testimony that would tell the story of the Jewish People in the 20th century in general, and during the Second World War in particular. At the centre of this chronicle are the manifestations of Jewish resistance: the organised uprisings of Jews in the ghettos and camps, and the Jews who fought in partisan units and the armies of the Allied forces. The Ghetto Fighters\u2019 House archive holds over 2,500,000 objects, including letters, certificates, diaries and testimonies (written, audio and video), films, photographs and displays. The archive collections comprise the history of the Jewish nation on all five continents during the first half of the 20th century and cover a wide range of areas such as the spiritual life, traditions and religion, society, education, economics, Holocaust and resistance, and the nation\u2019s revival in the Land of Israel.\r\n\r\n*Jabotinsky Institute in Israel*\r\n\r\nThe Jabotinsky Institute in Israel was founded in 1937 with the aim of collecting and serving as a repository for documents, publications and photographic material associated with Ze'ev Jabotinsky and the Revisionist Movement. Today, about 400 personal archives of Ze'ev Jabotinsky and his family are stored in the Institute, as well as archives of the leaders of the Revisionist Movement. In addition, the collection includes 215 archives relating to the various branches of the National Movement and its institutions such as the Union of Zionists Revisionists (Hatzohar); The New Zionist Organization (N.Z.O); The Betar Youth movement and its Israeli and international branches; The National Labor Federation; and Keren Tel-Hai.\r\n\r\n*Massuah Institute for the Study of the Holocaust*\r\n\r\nThe Massuah Institute, an institution historically affiliated with the Zionist liberal Progressive Party, contains a museum and an international seminar centre designed to evoke discourse on the significance of the Holocaust in our contemporary society and culture. The Document Archive comprises a collection of documents and publications related to the Holocaust, the Jewish world prior to the Holocaust \u2013 community institutions, youth movements and collections of personal documents. It is the chief archive of the history of the Hanoar Hazioni and Akiva youth movements. The documents are arranged according to subject in 12 units. Among them are unique collections of postal items from the time of the Holocaust, personal testimonies of Holocaust survivors and personal archives.\r\n\r\n*Moreshet*\r\n\r\nEstablished in 1961, Moreshet, Mordechai Anielevich Memorial Holocaust Study and Research Centre, affiliated with the Hashomer Hatzair movement, is dedicated to the commemoration of Jewish organised resistance during the Second World War and the Holocaust. The Moreshet archive holds a vast body of testimonies \u2013 personal and collective, collected in the years following the liberation and later on. The unique documents preserved in the Moreshet archive include many documents relating to the underground movement that operated in the Vilna ghetto, the pioneer underground in Hungary, documentation of the Slovakian revolt and other documents about the support and rescue of Jewish refugees during and after the war. Another interesting section in the archive is a collection of more than a hundred personal war diaries, which give a direct insight into the experiences and feelings of their writers. Finally, it holds a fascinating collection of arts and craft works that survived the war.\r\n\r\n*National Library of Israel*\r\n\r\nThe National Library of Israel includes a growing number of collections, such as but not limited to:\r\n- A nearly complete collection of secondary literature on the Holocaust in tens of languages\r\n- Archives of individual cultural heroes, artists, scholars, and authors who perished in the Holocaust, emigrated or fled due to rising European anti-Semitism, survived the Holocaust, or created art and culture related to the Holocaust (including documents from Stefan Zweig, Avraham Sutzkever and the cultural life in the Vilna Ghetto, Anita Shapira, and others)\r\n- Archival material related to the Land of Israel during WWII and Jewish Soldiers during the war, as well as the relocation of survivors to Palestine and later the State of Israel\r\n- Several oral history collections and ethnographic recordings related to the Holocaust and its survivors, particularly but not exclusively materials gathered by the Oral History Division of the Hebrew University\r\n- A music collection that includes thousands of recordings of Holocaust related music\r\n- Collections of published material by and for the She'erit Hapelatah, including ritual texts, newspapers, children's books, and others, including a complete set of the Survivors' Talmud \r\n- Several diaries of Holocaust survivors, including that of Menachem Oppenheim written in the margins of his prayer book\r\n- The Historical Jewish Press site, includes hundreds of thousands of pages of full-text searchable Jewish newspapers from Europe and around the world from the 1930s and 1940s\r\n- Meta-data about some of the items in the collections that were distributed by Jewish Cultural Reconstruction\r\n- The USC Shoah Foundation (USC SFI) has partnered with the National Library of Israel to provide Israeli users with the first countrywide access to USC SFI's entire Visual History Archive, including testimonies from more than 52,000 Holocaust survivors and hundreds of survivors of the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks\r\n\r\n*Beith Theresienstadt*\r\n\r\nBeit Terezin archives contain original documents in addition to photocopies of documents stored in other institutions, all pertaining to the ghetto period, and including a catalogue listing details of about 160,000 prisoners of Ghetto Theresienstadt. Over 900 files are classified under topics such as: art, literature, self-administration, medicine, labor department, children\u2019s homes, children\u2019s comics, music, academic studies, research, personal testimonies, and biographical information.\r\n\r\nAn integral part of the archive is the library which contains about 5,000 books, periodicals, catalogues, sheets of music composed and performed in the ghetto, documentary films, audio recordings, in Hebrew and other languages.\r\n\r\nThe world\u2019s largest collection of drawings, paintings and sculptures created by adults and children while they were interned in Ghetto Theresienstadt is perhaps the \u201cbackbone\u201d of the archive, and also includes Judaica objects and everyday objects.\r\n\r\n*The Wiener Library for the Study of the Nazi era and the Holocaust at Tel Aviv University*\r\n\r\nThe Wiener Library for the Study for the Study of the Nazi Era and the Holocaust is a steadily growing research library and comprises old and new publications on the Third Reich, during and between the two world wars, Jewish communities in Europe, the Holocaust, anti-Semitism, and fascism throughout the world. As a research library affiliated to the Sourasky Central Library of Tel Aviv University, it offers access to extensive archival sources, books, journals, and databases for researchers worldwide. The library continues to develop and enhance its collections, provides guidance in retrieving information and locating material, initiates conferences, seminars and lecture series, encourages and coordinates research projects, and collaborates with scholars, research institutes, archives and other research libraries.\r\n\r\n*Shem Olam, Faith and the Holocaust Institute for Education Documentation and Research*\r\n\r\nThe Shem Olam Institute has harnessed itself and others to carry out research using historical scientific tools, while uncovering documents and unfamiliar sources relating to the world of values, faith, religious and spiritual life, which focus attention on coping in the Holocaust. \r\n\r\nThe EHRI Portal furthermore provides collection descriptions from the Leo Baeck Institute and other institutions.

              "extensive": "Disclaimer: The EHRI Extensive Report was updated in 2024.\r\n\r\n**A. EHRI approach to Italy: Pre-existing research, archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nLacking a pre-existing specific, thematic guide about Holocaust documentation in Italy, the EHRI approach to Italy was based on two pillars. The first focused on the collections held by the Foundation Jewish Contemporary Documentation Center (CDEC). The bulk of research on the Holocaust in Italy has been carried out by the scholars of this institution, which began collecting documents in the 1960s and now holds a large number of copy collections from many of the Italian State Archives. These fragments have been used as a directory for deeper investigation in their originating institutions. The second pillar focused on research concerning the persecution of the Jews in Italy.\r\n\r\nGeneral guides to the Italian archival heritage are available on both paper and in digital format. See, for example, the *General Guide to the State Archives* [*Guida generale degli Archivi di Stato*, a cura di Claudio Pavone, Piero D\u2019Angiolini, Roma, 1966-1969], which is also available online through a dedicated platform where information can be easily searched: http://www.guidageneralearchivistato.beniculturali.it/\r\n\r\nAs for the diocesan archives, a useful paper guide has been published as a special issue of the Journal *Rassegna degli Archivi di Stato in 1998. See, Guida degli Archivi diocesan d\u2019Italia*, a cura di V. Monachino, E. Boaga, L. Osbat, S. Palese, Roma, Ministero per i beni culturali e ambientali. Ufficio centrale per i Beni Archivistici, 1998.\r\n\r\nThe Central State Archives provides access to interviews from the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education with Italian Holocaust survivors, available through the online portal Ti racconto la storia: voci dalla Shoah: http://www.shoah.acs.beniculturali.it/.\"\r\n\r\nEHRI has found the web portal of the Archival Superintendencies, Sistema Informativo Unificato per le Soprintendenze Archivistiche (SIUSA) particularly useful for navigating the archives of local Jewish communities: http://siusa.archivi.beniculturali.it/. In particular, it is worth mentioning that there is athe  thematic section devoted to the Archives for the Jewish history (Archivi per la storia dell\u2019ebraismo):  https://siusa-archivi.cultura.gov.it/cgi-bin/siusa/pagina.pl?RicProgetto=ebrais\r\n\r\nOn the SIUSA web portal, there is also a useful \u201cGuide to Archives of the Resistance\u201d [Guida agli Archivi della Resistenza]: http://siusa.archivi.beniculturali.it/cgi-bin/pagina.pl?TipoPag=strumcorr&Chiave=27763. As for the numerous collections of the Institutes for the History of the Resistance, their collections can be browsed through an integrated web portal at: http://www.reteparri.it/patrimonio/\r\n\r\nApart from SIUSA, other databases and web-portals that have been useful in the identification of Holocaust-relevant archival institutions and collections include Sistema Archivistico Nazionale \u2013 http://san.beniculturali.it \u2013 as well as Sistema Informativo degli Archivi di Stato (SIAS): http://sias.archivi.beniculturali.it/cgi-bin/pagina.pl?RicVM=archivi\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Italian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAs a systematic cataloguing of Holocaust-related material scattered throughout Italian archival institutions has not yet been done at a national nor local level, a good knowledge of the history of the Italian administrative bodies together with authoritative historiographical works can help in the task of the identification of Holocaust related material. High and medium level archival descriptions \u2013 in some cases also full inventories \u2013 of the documentation held by the wide network of public and private institutions in Italy are available online thanks to an integrated and continuously updated web portal, the National Archival System [Sistema Archivistico Nazionale, SAN]. It works as a national access point to information on archival resources . However, these descriptions are often insufficient to identify the collections within which Holocaust-related documentation is present. For example, the Central State Archives in Rome hold a large amount of documentation about all aspects of persecution of the Jews, but this is only partially reported in both the online and paper finding aids. The same goes for the State Archives, where scholars can definitely find useful documentation in the \u201cQuestura\u201d and \u201cPrefettura\u201d fonds, even though the finding aids do not always mention the presence of this kind of material.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is important to note that there have been a number of initiatives and projects aimed to make material and documentation about the Holocaust accessible to a wider audience in recent years. For example, the State Archives of Venice are digitising documents related to the persecution of the Jews in Venice; the State Archives of Trieste are working on a project aiming to describe and index their Holocaust related documentation (especially those related to the Coroneo prison, which are very important for the identification of the victims arrested and/or deported from Trieste; and the Municipal (or City) Archives of Milan are reordering their collection on the full 1938 Racial census (more than 3,500 papers, which refer to every Jewish family residing in Milan) and are planning to write descriptions for this documentation.\r\n\r\nWhile both the Central State Archives and regional State Archives hold documentation that enables research on the administrative machinery behind the persecution of the Jews, researchers can find material documenting the impact of this persecution from the victims\u2019 perspectives at Jewish institutions and archives. This is the case of the Foundation \u201cContemporary Jewish Documentation Center\u201d [Fondazione Centro di Documentazione Ebraica Contemporanea, CDEC], whose collections and databases are primarily focused on the personal documents and testimonies of Holocaust victims and partisan Jews. The historical Archives of the Union of the Italian Jewish Community [Unione delle Comunit\u00e0 ebraiche Italiane, UCEI] provides documentation about the reactions of the top Jewish political and administrative management to the Fascist regime, racial laws and persecution, as well post-war policies and activities for rebuilding the Italian Jewish communities after the Holocaust. It also holds relevant documentation about the relationships established with the State administrative bodies. This kind of documentation can be found at the historical archives of almost every Italian Jewish community archive, especially those of the major urban centres \u2013 Rome, Milan, Turin, Florence, Venice and Trieste. For these major centres, the principal Jewish institutions and archives are the CDEC Foundation; the Historical Archives of the Jewish Community of Rome (https://ascer.roma.it/); the Carlo and Vera Wagner Museum in Trieste; the Library Archive Renato Maestro in Venice (http://renatomaestro.org/it/); the Benvenuto and Umberto Terracini Archives in Turin (https://www.archivioterracini.it/patrimonio/archivi/); and the Historical Archives of the Jewish Community of Florence (https://www.firenzebraica.it/biblioteca-e-archivio/).\r\n\r\nThe National Museum of Italian Jewry and the Shoah [Museo Nazionale dell\u2019Ebraismo Italiano e della Shoah, MEIS] in Ferrara as well as the Museum of the Shoah [Museo della Shoah] in Rome are under construction and they are still collecting material and documents, while the Memoriale della Shoah in Milan does not collect documents.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these two main categories of archival institutions, there is a third, more diverse group of private institutions that offer valuable documentation and information about the Holocaust in Italy. Notably, there is a network of 64 Institutes for the History of the Resistance Movement (Rete degli Istituti per la storia della Resistenza e dell\u2019et\u00e0 contemporanea) spread across Italy and coordinated by the Istituto Nazionale Ferruccio Parri in Milan (formerly the Istituto Nazionale per la Storia del Movimento di Liberazione in Italia). The Archive of the Fondazione Memoria della Deportazione contains extensive materials and documentation on antifascist deportees. There are also numerous Catholic Parish and Diocesan archives. The Istituto Luce Cinecitt\u00e0, the leading institute for audiovisual materials from the 1920s to the 1960s, holds a rich collection. The historical archives of the former Banca Commerciale Italiana, now part of the Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Group (with archival branches in Milan, Turin, Rome, and Bologna), contain a wealth of documentation related to the confiscation and restitution of Jewish assets, notably the Fondo EGELI (Ente di Gestione e Liquidazione Immobiliare). (https://asisp.intesasanpaolo.com/egeli/archive-fond/egeli). Since 2024, Intesa Sanpaolo's EGELI data have been available in Linked Open Data format at the following link: https://dati-asisp.intesasanpaolo.com/lod/resource/Dataset/BeniEbraici.html.\r\nAdditional documentation concerning EGELI is also available at the Fondazione 1563 Archive in Turin (https://archiviostorico.fondazione1563.it/oggetti/98550-iii-gestioni-egeli-ente-di-gestione-e-liquidazione-immobiliare-dell-istituto-di-san-paolo-di-torino/). Lastly, for insights into Jewish commercial and industrial activities in Italy, the historical archives of local Chambers of Commerce, one in each province, could prove useful.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI Identification and description of results**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Italy**\r\n\r\nAs a result of the identification process in Italy, EHRI has been able to provide descriptions for over 90 institutions. In particular, EHRI began with the identification of collections at the Central State Archives (ACS), local State Archives (AS), and the CDEC Foundation.\r\n\r\nIn general terms, the ACS collections hold documentation concerning the measures taken by the Fascist administration against the Jews while the material held by the local State Archives documents the practical implementation of such measures at the local level. At the Central State Archives, EHRI carried out identification work on the following six collections:\r\n- Ministero degli Interni [Ministry of Interior]\r\n- Ministero delle Finanze [Financial Ministry]\r\n- Ministero della Cultura Popolare [Ministry of Popular Culture]\r\n- Archivi fascisti [Fascist Archives]\r\n- EGELI \u2013 Ente Gestione e Liquidazione Immobiliare\r\n- Ministero per l\u2019assistenza post-bellica [Ministry for Post-War Assistance]\r\n\r\nDescribing these collections provides an extensive and multifaceted overview of the material created by ministries and administrative bodies during the Fascist years and after the war. However, given the extent of these collections, the survey and the identification of Holocaust-related material at the ACS is far from complete.\r\n\r\nRegarding the local State Archives, the fonds \u201cQuestura\u201d and \u201cPrefettura\u201d of each of the nearly 30 local State Archives which have collection descriptions have been found particularly relevant in documenting the various phases and measures taken by the Fascist regime against the Jews in Italy \u2013 Italian and foreigners \u2013 from 1938 to 1945.\r\n\r\nThe combination of documentation from the Central State Archives and local State Archives paints a rather detailed picture of how the administrative machine worked at both central and local levels. On the other hand, the documentation imported into the EHRI portal from Jewish institutions and archives \u2013 including the Union of the Italian Jewish Communities, several local Jewish Communities and the CDEC Foundation \u2013 provides perspectives of those persecuted by the Fascist regime and their reactions to such measures.\r\n\r\nThe CDEC Foundation\u2019s collecting policies have focused on obtaining documentation linked to the persecution of the Jews and Jewish participation in the Resistance. Consequently, the Foundation\u2019s materials focus on individuals and their testimonies about their psychological and physical suffering. From this perspective, the paper collections \u201cVicissitudini dei singoli\u201d, \u201cCRDE \u2013 Comitato Ricerche Deportati Ebrei\u201d and \u201cMassimo Adolfo Vitale\u201d are particularly interesting, as is its photographic collection [\u201cCollezione Fotografie Vittime della Shoah\u201d], and its collection of audio and video interviews [\u201cTestimonianze sulla Shoah\u201d], which the CDEC has been recording since the early 1980s. In addition to the collections cited above, the documents created by the CDEC Foundation on the occasion of the trial (1964-1973) against Friedrich Bo\u00dfhammer \u2013 the Nazi officer responsible for the mass deportation of Jews from Italy \u2013 also deserve a special mention. On that occasion, CDEC was in charge of collecting both direct survivor testimonies as well as documentation from several local State Archives in order to assist in the prosecution of Bo\u00dfhammer. Most of this documentation is now gathered both in the collections \u201cProcesso Bosshammer\u201d and \u201cCollezione Archivi Italiani e stranieri\u201d.\r\n\r\nApart from these main lines of inquiry, EHRI has also provided top and medium level descriptions from the Archives of the Union of the Italian Jewish Communities (UCEI) (http://archiviostorico.ucei.it/ucei-web/). The UCEI\u2019s collections give a wide overview of the activities of the Italian Jewish leadership from the 1930s until the end of the war and the years afterward. Among other things these collections are particularly relevant from the point of view of the relationship between the Union and the Fascist government. Furthermore, it provides a rich corpus of documents regarding the measures of assistance towards Jewish refugees since the early 1930s.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Italy, material relevant to the Holocaust in Italy can be found in a number of institutions, including the German Bundesarchiv, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University, and Yad Vashem in Israel."

Characteristics of the Kyrgyz archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe majority of the central and regional Kyrgyz archives were founded during the pre-war Soviet period. Consequently, most of them are based on the Soviet system of cataloging and most of the inventory files are written in Russian to this day. There are other archival institutions that were established or restructured after Kyrgyzstan\u2019s independence. The former Archive of the Communist Party of Kyrgyzstan was renamed the Central State Archive of Social-Political Documentation. It holds a considerable collection of decrees related to the evacuation, the war effort and the history of the Jews. As a result of regime changes and administrative reforms, some archival institutions in Kyrgyzstan have been renamed, which may cause some initial confusion among researchers.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Kyrgyzstan**\r\n\r\nIn Kyrgyzstan, EHRI identified over fifteen archival institutions which hold or may hold Holocaust-relevant material. Four of the most important of them are concentrated in the republic\u2019s former capital, Bishkek. The Central State Archive alone stores some 4,000 fonds, and the regional archives of Osh, Tokmok and Jalal-Abad hold a similarly impressive number of collections. Given the scale of mass evacuation and escape to Kyrgyzstan during the Second World War, many Holocaust-relevant collections are either known to be stored or can be expected to be found in the country\u2019s archives. \r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Kyrgyzstan, EHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections that may prove relevant to Holocaust research on Kyrgyzstan. For instance, the State Archives of the Russian Federation and the Russian State Archives of Socio-Political History (former Central Communist Party Archive) in Moscow hold records and circulars sent to various Socialist Republics and have a large fonds on evacuation. In Israel, Yad Vashem holds documentation from archives in Kyrgyzstan from 1930 to 1960 and the Archives of the History of the Jewish people in Jerusalem also hold a handful of collections related to this period. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum stores selected records from the Central State Archive of Kyrgyzstan.\r\n"

EHRI approach to Lithuania: Pre-existing research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nEHRI\u2019s exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in Lithuania could rely on some important pre-existing research in the field, such as Christoph Dieckmann\u2019s *Deutsche Besatzungspolitik in Litauen 1941-1944* (2011), which makes extensive use of archival material available in the country. EHRI also worked closely with the Vilna Gaon Museum of Jewish History in Vilnius, which became a consortium partner during EHRI\u2019s second phase. Thanks to the support of this institution, EHRI has been able to identify important collections in over ten different institutions. There is one helpful archival guide on Holocaust-relevant sources in the Lithuanian Central State Archive, which is written in both Lithuanian and English:\r\n\r\n- [2011] Z\u030cirikova, Galina, *Lietuvos centrinio valstybe\u0307s archyvo fondai: holokausto Lietuvoje tyrimo s\u030caltinis* (*The Collections of the State Archive of Lithuania: a Source of Research on the Holocaust in Lithuania*), Vilnius: Valstybinis Vilniaus Gaono Z\u030cydu\u0328 Muziejus, 2011.\r\n\r\nLitvakSIG (Lithuanian-Jewish Special Interest Group) is the primary internet resource for Lithuanian-Jewish (Litvak) genealogy research worldwide. All the data is available via the All Lithuania Database, a freely searchable database which has more than 2,500,000 records transcribed and translated from various archival institutions in Lithuania and abroad:\r\n- https://www.litvaksig.org/\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Lithuania\u2019s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAn important number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created or are deposited in Lithuania and can still be found in the country\u2019s archives today. The Chief Archivist\u2019s Office allows free access to all fonds. Some restrictions may apply to files containing personal data, but even these can be used either by relatives of the persons named in such files, or for academic survey purposes after applying for a special permission to the archive\u2019s director. Restricted source material cannot be published.\r\n\r\nOn a practical level, a working knowledge of Lithuanian and/or Russian is helpful for any kind of archival research in Lithuania, even though documents in other languages can also be found with the help of the local archival staff. Beyond that, archives in Lithuania offer a wide range of research tools, ranging from traditional card index catalogues to electronic catalogues. The digitalisation of file and fonds descriptions is in progress in most archives.\r\n\r\nConcerning Holocaust research, finding relevant documents can be difficult due to a certain lack of accuracy in available collection descriptions. EHRI\u2019s expert on Lithuania estimates that only some 15% of all relevant descriptions actually contain the word \"Holocaust\", while the other 85%, which are potentially equally important, remain obscured. For instance, fonds on the Vilnius, Kaunas and \u0160iaulai ghettos are rather easy to find, while sources on the provincial regions of Lithuania are harder to come by. On the other hand, the Lithuanian Special Archives\u2019 reading room offers an electronic register of participants in the Holocaust, such as Kaunas policemen in 1941/42. The names of participants and bystanders can be found, for instance, in survivor\u2019s testimonies at the Lithuanian Central Archives. In the light of these findings, EHRI has made considerable headway in identifying and describing Holocaust-relevant collections in Lithuania, but the full potential of the country\u2019s archival institutions remains to be determined. A survey of the collections held by small local museums in Lithuania, of private collections and of surviving photographs from the Holocaust period, is highly desirable.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Lithuania**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Lithuania**\r\n\r\nIn Lithuania, EHRI has identified over 10 archival institutions which hold Holocaust-related collections. Most of them are concentrated in the country\u2019s capital, Vilnius. At the Lithuanian Central State Archives alone, EHRI has identified and described over 160 Holocaust-relevant collections, which contain, among others, sources produced by German District and Police Chiefs, various municipalities and prison administrations. At the other five Vilnius-based institutions, over 160 additional Holocaust-relevant collections have been identified and described so far. The Lithuanian Special Archives, for instance, contain the cases and trials of collaborators who persecuted Jews in Lithuania. The Vilna Gaon Museum of Jewish History, to which the Lithuanian Central State Archive has re-transferred a former collection in 1998 (parts of the LCVA fonds RG 1390 was catalogued under call number V\u017dM at the Museum) keeps records about Jews murdered in various Lithuanian cities, as well as relevant copied source material from archives in neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified a number of archival institutions outside of Lithuania, which hold or may hold collections relevant for Holocaust research on Lithuania. Vast collections on the Holocaust period in Lithuania can be found at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, Yad Vashem, the Jewish Heritage Museum in NYC collections, the Ghetto Fighters' House Archives, Beit Hatfutsot: Museum of the Jewish People in Tel Aviv, and the National Library of Israel. Furthermore the Belarusian State Archive-Museum of Literature and Art [Belarussskij Gosudarstvennyj Archiv-Muzej Literatury i Iskusstva] and the State Archive of the Russian Federation [Gosudarstvennij Archiv Rossijskoj Federacii, GARF] hold collections on Lithuania which may be relevant to Holocaust research, but EHRI has yet to explore their exact nature and importance."

EHRI approach to Luxembourg: Pre-existing Research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nUntil recently Holocaust remained under-researched in Luxembourg, which was in part due to the fact that the country did not have its own university before 2003. Until then, academic research depended mainly on private endeavours undertaken abroad. Since the establishment of the university, two Holocaust-relevant conferences have taken place in Luxembourg, the results of which will be published shortly. Moreover, the Universit\u00e9 de Luxembourg\u2019s history department has launched a project to interview contemporary witnesses of the Second World War, which may lead to a number of Holocaust survivor testimonies. Furthermore, there is an exhibition catalogue on the \u201cExilland Luxemburg 1933-1947\u201d, which deals with, among other things, racial refugees from Germany brought to Luxembourg during the 1930s, and resulted in the publication of Hugo Heumann\u2019s memoirs, *Erlebtes und Erlittenes. Von M\u00f6nchengladbach \u00fcber Luxemburg nach Theresienstadt. Tagebuch eines deutsch-j\u00fcdischen Emigranten* (2007). A catalogue on another exhibition shown in the Mus\u00e9e national de la R\u00e9sistance under the title \u201cBetween Shade and Darkness. Le sort des Juifs du Luxembourg de 1940 \u00e0 1945\u201d was reprinted in 2016. There is also a recent, albeit non-academic, publication on the Jews of Luxembourg, published by Laurent Moyse: *Du rejet \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9gration. Histoire des Juifs du Luxembourg des origines \u00e0 nos jours* (2011).\r\n\r\nWorking with the Centre de Documentation et Recherche sur la R\u00e9sistance (which has since closed) and the contemporary history section of the National Archives of Luxembourg, EHRI\u2019s on-site surveys identified key archival institutions and two helpful archival guides :\r\n\r\n- [2003/1995] Spang, Paul, *Etat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des fonds conserv\u00e9s aux Archives nationales du Grand Duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg et aux archives de la Section historique de l\u2019Institut grand-ducal* (Luxembourg, Publications de la Section historique de l'Institut grand-ducal, vol. 112-113: tome 1 1995, tome 2 2003)\r\n\r\n- [1978] *Grand-Duche\u0301 de Luxembourg: Archives de l'Etat.

Characteristics of the Luxembourg archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe main archives are the National Archives located in Luxembourg City. A law on the archives was passed in 2018. In general, access is granted to documents older than 30 years. The files originating from the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office are only accessible with a special permission from the Prosecutor General. Luxembourg also has private archives. Holocaust-related collections held by the National Archives include material generated by Luxembourg\u2019s administration (both at home and in exile), the German occupation authorities, financial agencies, Jewish bodies and post-war investigations. The National Archives have also acquired the collections of the Centre de Documentation et de Recherche sur la R\u00e9sistance when it closed in 2016. The archives of the city of Luxembourg possess some files related to the synagogue and its destruction. The local archives of Grevenmacher, Mondorf, Esch/Alzette, Differdange, Dudelange, Ettelbruck, towns where Jewish communities existed before the German occupation of Luxembourg, may keep some files pertaining to these communities. The local archives of Wintger keep a card file of those Jews imprisoned in the small ghetto of F\u00fcnfbrunnen [Cinqfontaines] before their deportation.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Luxembourg**\r\n\r\n**C.I.

EHRI approach to Latvia: Pre-existing research, archival guides and expert support**\r\n\r\nEHRI\u2019s exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in Latvia could rely on some important pre-existing research in the field, such as Katrin Reichelt\u2019s *Lettland unter deutscher Besatzung 41-1944. Der lettische Anteil am Holocaust* (2011), and Andrej Angrick\u2019s and Peter Klein\u2019s *The Final Solution in Riga: Exploitation and Annihilation, 1941-1944* (2009).\r\n\r\nWorking extensively with the National Archives of Latvia, EHRI was able to identify important collections in three Riga-based archives: the National Archives of Latvia, State Historical Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacion\u0101l\u0101 arh\u012bva Latvijas Valsts v\u0113stures arh\u012bvs, LNA LVVA]; the National Archives of Latvia, State Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacion\u0101l\u0101 arh\u012bva Latvijas Valst arh\u012bvs, LNA LVA]; and the Latvia State Archive of Audiovisual Documents [Latvijas Valsts kinofotofonodokumentu arhivs]. \r\n\r\nAn overview of Latvian State Archives, which is written in both Latvian and English and available in print and online, suggests that there are more Holocaust-relevant archives to discover, especially among the eleven Regional State Archives:\r\n\r\n- [2004] Bus\u030cmane, Inta/Maija A\u0304boltin\u0326a (ed.), *Valsts arhi\u0304vi Latvija\u0304 / Latvia state archives* (Riga: Latvijas Valsts arhi\u0304vu g\u0315enera\u0304ldirekcija : \"Mantojums\", [2004]), (http://www.arhivi.lv/sitedata/VAS/Arhivu%20vesture/Latvijas%20valsts%20arhivi.pdf)\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Latvia\u2019s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAn important number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created or have been deposited in Latvia and can still be found in the country\u2019s archives today. Access to them appears to be unrestricted, but some limits to the use of personal data are to be expected. The most frequent languages of the sources are German, Russian and Latvian. On a practical level, a working knowledge of Latvian and/or Russian is probably necessary for any kind of archival research in Latvia, even though documents in other languages can also be found with the help of the local archival staff.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Latvia**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Latvia**\r\n\r\nHolocaust-relevant sources in Latvia are concentrated in the country\u2019s capital, Riga and in two archives in particular:\r\n\r\n- the National Archives of Latvia, State Historical Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacion\u0101l\u0101 arh\u012bva Latvijas Valsts v\u0113stures arh\u012bvs, LNA LVVA], which keeps mostly documents from the period until 1944, and\r\n\r\n- the National Archives of Latvia, State Archives of Latvia [Latvijas Nacion\u0101l\u0101 arh\u012bva Latvijas Valst arh\u012bvs, LNA LVA], which keep documents from the period since 1945.\r\n\r\nAt the State Historical Archives alone, EHRI has identified and described over 50 Holocaust-related fonds, some of which contain thousands of files pertaining to all of Latvia or to certain regions, districts and cities. The fonds identified and described by EHRI include collections of sources produced by German occupation and administrative authorities, such as the Reichskommissar Ostland or the SS and Police Leader in Latvia, but also ample sources left by local Latvian institutions, e.g. very extensive District Police records. The sources for the survey consisted of the, mostly printed, finding aids available at the archives. For example, the fonds of the Commissar General in Riga contains seven finding aids that describe the German records in Latvian. These handwritten and typed finding aids are available at the reading room.\r\n\r\nAt the State Archives of Latvia, EHRI has identified three important Holocaust-related fonds of Soviet origin, which contain material on war crimes investigations in Latvia. The identification and investigation work on these two fonds was carried out by local experts. Most of the work consisted of document analysis and research on previously undescribed archive fonds no. 1986. The work included reviewing the fonds card index (93,608 cards) and 26 record registration journals. As this fonds had no description, it was necessary to compare the data in the card index with the data in the registration journals to find certain criminal cases (persons convicted or judged). These criminal cases are usually several volumes long. To find all information about the Holocaust victims, one would have to examine all 52,653 records. The survey team looked through the criminal cases which consisted of a large number volumes, such as the files of Victor Ar\u0101js (1910-1988) and Bo\u013ceslavs Maikovskis (1904-1996). The former was the Chief of the Ar\u0101js Command who committed mass executions of Jews for the German Security Police. Ar\u0101js was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1979 by a Hamburg court. Boleslavs Maikovskis was a Latvian who served as chief of police for the second precinct of R\u0113zekne during the German occupation of Latvia in the Second World War. Maikovskis was tried under the German court system in 1988, but by 1994 was deemed too frail to continue the trial. Together, these cases are enclosed in dozens of volumes. Approximately 90% of the KGB documents are in Russian.\r\n\r\nEHRI has also added collection descriptions of sources held by the Latvia State Archive of Audiovisual Documents [Latvijas Valsts kinofotofonodokumentu arhivs].\r\n\r\nIn addition to the three archives named above, EHRI has identified four more institutions in Riga which hold Holocaust-relevant material on Latvia:\r\n\r\n- the Museum \u201cJews in Latvia\u201d [Muzejs \u201cEbreji Latvij\u0101],\r\n\r\n- the Museum of the Occupation of Latvia 1940-1991 [Latvijas Okup\u0101cijas muzejs],\r\n\r\n- the Riga Ghetto and Latvian Holocaust Museum [R\u012bga geto un Latvijas Holokausta muzejs].\r\n\r\n- National Archives of Latvia - State Archives of Personnel Documents [Latvijas Nacion\u0101lais arh\u012bvs - Person\u0101la dokumentu valsts arh\u012bvs]\r\n\r\nThe repository descriptions for these institutions provide researchers with general information on the materials that can be found here.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Latvia, sources relevant to Holocaust research on Latvia can be found at Yad Vashem, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies and other locations.\r\n"

EHRI approach to Moldova: Pre-existing research, available archival guides and expert support**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Moldova, EHRI could rely on a number of pre-existing works on the Holocaust in Romania, as well as a number of works specifically devoted to the Holocaust in Bessarabia and Transnistria. These works include the following monographs: Jean Ancel, *Documents Concerning the Fate of the Romanian Jewry during the Holocaust*, 12 vols. (New York: Beate Klarsfeld Foundation, 1986); Jean Ancel, *Transnistria, 1941-1942*, 3 vols. (Tel Aviv: The Goldstein-Goren Diaspora Research Center, 2003); Radu Ioanid, *The Holocaust in Romania: The Destruction of Jews and Gypsies Under the Antonescu Regime, 1940-1944* (Ivan R. Dee, 2008); Dennis Deletant, *Hitler's Forgotten Ally: Ion Antonescu and his Regime, Romania 1940-1944* (Springer, 2006); Diana Dumitru, *The State, Antisemitism, and Collaboration in the Holocaust: The Borderlands of Romania and the Soviet Union* (Cambridge University Press, 2016); Vladimir Solonari, *Purifying the Nation: Population Exchange and Ethnic Cleansing in Nazi-Allied Romania* (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009). EHRI has also relied on third parties that had previously carried out survey and copying work, such as the USHMM and Yad Vashem. \r\n\r\nEHRI did not identify finding aids specifically devoted to archival documents regarding wartime Bessarabia and Transnistria, but instead relied on available finding aids for different archives in Moldova. Four archival aids must be mentioned in particular: \r\n\r\n- *Tsentral'nyy Gosudarstvennyy Arkhiv Moldavskoy SSR i yego filial v g. Tiraspole, kratkiy spravochnik* [Central State Archive of the Moldavian SSR and its branch in Tiraspol, a brief finding aid] (Kishinev: \"Shtiintsa\", 1988)\r\n\r\n- *\u00cendrum\u0103torul Arhivei Na\u0163ionale a Republicii Moldova (partea II-a, 1918 \u2013 \u00eenceputul secolului XXI*, edi\u0163ia a II-a, rev\u0103zut\u0103 \u015fi completat\u0103) [The Guide of the National Archive of the Republic of Moldova (Part II, 1918 - beginning of XXI century, second edition, revised and supplemented)] (Chi\u015fin\u0103u, 2012)\r\n\r\n- *Arhiva Organiza\u0163iilor Social-Politice a Republicii Moldova. \u00cendrum\u0103tor* [Archives of the Social-Political Organizations of the Republic of Moldova. Finding aid] (Chi\u015fin\u0103u, 2008)\r\n\r\n- *Tsentral'nyy Gosudarstvennyy Arkhiv Pridnestrovskoy Moldavskoy Respubliki. Putevoditel\u2019* [Central State Archive of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic. Finding aid] (Tiraspol', 2010)\r\n\r\nRelying on these finding aids, EHRI identified relevant archival fonds, compared archival holdings in Moldova with the archival holdings copied from Moldovan archives by the USHMM and Yad Vashem, and introduced both to the EHRI database.\r\n\r\nEHRI established contact with the director of the National Archives of the Republic of Moldova (NARM) in order to facilitate access to the Holocaust-relevant archival sources for EHRI Moldova country experts. Taking into account that a number of highly relevant documents are still stored at the Special State Repository of the Intelligence and Security Service (SIS), which regularly does not provide access to researchers, the full extent and importance of Holocaust-related documents held in Moldova is yet to be determined.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Moldova's archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nMoldova exhibits a highly centralized archival system and its administration, the State Archival Agency (Agen\u021bia Na\u021bional\u0103 a Arhivelor) is in charge of the State archival system. The state archives are made up of two major archives in Chisinau and multiple regional and departmental archives. For a guide to the Moldova's archival system and its history see Mihai Ta\u015fc\u0103 et al., Ghidul arhivelor din Republica Moldova [Guidebook for the Archives in the Republic of Moldova] (Chi\u0219in\u0103u: Pontos, 2011). Prewar archival documents of Bessarabia and MASSR are stored in the NARM due to centralization effort during the 1950s. \r\n\r\nThe main challenge regarding research in Moldova's archives is the accessibility of data. Some documents of the archival fonds remain partially closed to the public. In NARM and the Archives of Socio-Political Organizations of the Republic of Moldova [AOSP, Arhiva Organiza\u0163iilor Social-Politice ale Republicii Moldova] accessibility to inventories remains a challenge as the latter are only partially available in the reading rooms and must be requested separately. Access to thematic catalogues and the provision of advice and guidance to researchers are also often problematic. The archives in Moldova have only very recently started to digitise their collections.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Moldova**\r\n\r\n**C.I In Moldova**\r\n\r\nIn Moldova, EHRI has identified several archival institutions which hold or may hold Holocaust-relevant documents on Bessarabia and Transnistria. For these institutions, EHRI has made over 150 Holocaust-relevant archival descriptions available. In the NARM, EHRI identified documents on the prewar Jewish life and education, as well as wartime documents issued by the Romanian authorities related to administration of Bessarabia and Transnistria Governorate: directorates, town administrations [primaria], county administrations [prefectura] and district administrations [pretura], files of the gendarmery, corps of the Romanian army, police, tribunals, financial administration, chambers of commerce and industry, religious administration et altc. In the AOSP and Central State Archive of the (unrecognised) Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic [Tsentral'nyy Gosudarstvennyy Arkhiv Pridnestrovskoy Moldavskoy Respubliki], EHRI identified documents of the post-war Soviet authorities that mainly relate to the effort to assess the damage and human losses caused by the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n**C.II In other countries**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections outside of Moldova that are relevant to Holocaust research. Primarily, these are Holocaust-relevant collections at the USHMM, which has numerous microfilmed records from the NARM, as well as People\u2019s Commissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVD) war crimes investigation and trial documents, and dozens of oral history interviews from Moldova. EHRI identified and introduced files to the database that are stored at the NARM, but are not mentioned in the NARM finding aid. Copies of these files, however, are available in the USHMM, including the files of the Republican Board of the Moldovan SSR to promote the activity of the emergency state commission for the investigation of crimes committed by German-Fascist invaders (1943-1947). In Israel, at Yad Vashem, EHRI identified war crimes investigation and trial records copied from the Special State Repository of the Intelligence and Security Service.\r\n\r\n"

Characteristics of the North Macedonian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe State Archives of the Republic of North Macedonia are organised as an independent official administration body for performing archival activity throughout the entire state of North Macedonia. The State Archives manage a network of nine regional archives, which are located in Bitola, Kumanovo, Ohrid, Prilip, Skopje, Strumica, Tetovo, Titov Veles, and \u0160tip. Each archive functions as a separate department, \u043er as a dislocated organisational unit, of the State Archives and performs archival functions within a particular region of North Macedonia.\r\n\r\nThere are also Holocaust-relevant archives that function outside of the network of the State Archives, including the Archives of the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts (MASA) and the Archives of the Jewish Community in the Republic of Macedonia. The role of the MASA Archives is to collect, house, process, protect and make available archival materials produced by scientific, scholarly and artistic institutions, by the Academy or its individual members or by other individuals whose work is relevant to the sciences and arts in North Macedonia. As for the Archives of the Jewish Community, these were formed in the wake of the Second World War and they hold significant material from the period preceding and after the Holocaust.\r\n\r\n**C.

EHRI has identified Holocaust-related collections in the State Archives, including the fonds of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Macedonia/League of Communists of Macedonia, as well as material of a more local provenance in the regional archives of Bitola, Skopje and \u0160tip. In those institutions which work independently of the State Archives, EHRI has also described the Fonds Aleksandar Matkovski held by the Archives of the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts and a handful of registers and complaints held by the Jewish Community Archives.\r\n\r\n**C.

Notably, the national \u201cHeritage of War Programme\u201d (2005-2009) intended to preserve the memories about the war for future generations, provided EHRI with a solid starting point. Existing descriptions have also been taken from the database behind the website on Dutch WWII archival sources. In a few cases, more detailed descriptions have been taken directly from the institutions themselves, such as NIOD and the Amsterdam City Archives.\r\n\r\nEHRI was able to identify a number of helpful archival guides, both online and offline:\r\n\r\n- http://www.archievenwo2.nl\r\n\r\nThis site unifies information on archives and collections on National-Socialism and the Second World War concerning the Netherlands, the Dutch East Indies, Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles.

It is available in Dutch and English and is an initiative of the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies in collaboration with several other institutions (War Aftercare Department of the Netherlands Red Cross; Eemland Archive; Brabant Historical Information Centre (BHIC); Drenthe Archive; Midden-Drenthe Municipality Archive; Memorial Centre Camp Westerbork; National Monument Camp Amersfoort; National Monument Camp Vught; Regional Archive Alkmaar).\r\n\r\n- http://www.oorlogsgetroffenen.nl\r\n\r\nThis site unifies information on archives and collections from organizations involved in tracing, repatriating and sheltering victims of the Second World War in the aftermath of the conflict.

Characteristics of the Dutch archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAccording to the Dutch Public Records Act (1995), public archives are divided into State (Rijks), Communal (Gemeentelijke) and Regional (waterschaps) archival repositories. The National Archives [Nationaal Archief] are the central repository for archives transferred from national government bodies. The National Archivist is the head of the State Archive Service [Rijksarchiefdienst] and the Dutch National Archives. Besides the National Archives in The Hague, there are ten State Archives in the other provincial capitals, which were transformed (often after a merger with the city archives) into Regional Historical Centres [Regionaal Historische Centra] between 1998 and 2005. In addition to the state archives, there are collections in private archives and museums. A working knowledge of Dutch is necessary for any kind of archival research in the Netherlands, even though documents in other languages (German, English and French) can also be found with the help of the local archival staff.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on the Netherlands**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In the Netherlands**\r\n\r\nA considerable number of Holocaust-related sources and collections were created in the Netherlands and can still be found in the country\u2019s archives today. NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies holds important Holocaust collections. A joint effort of the National Archives and NIOD led to the creation of a website on Dutch WWII archival sources. A thematic query on \u201cpersecution of the Jews\u201d leads to 773 archival collections in 142 archival institutions. These cover a broad variety of institutions, national as well as local and specialised institutions. There are also a number of private archives and documentation centres, such as the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam, which hold important Holocaust-related collections.\r\nEHRI identified over 160 repositories in the Netherlands and is able to provide thousands of descriptions of Holocaust-relevant archival units, most of which can be found at NIOD and at the Amsterdam City Archives.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections outside of the Netherlands that are relevant to Holocaust research on the Netherlands. In Germany and Israel, the Arolsen Archives and Yad Vashem hold significant documentation and a huge quantity of sources pertaining to Jewish individuals and/or groups during the Holocaust period."

EHRI approach to Poland: Pre-existing research and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Poland, EHRI could rely on a vast amount of pre-existing research on the Holocaust. Research on this topic has been conducted for decades now by historians not only in Poland, Germany, the United States and Israel, but also in a number of other countries. Consequently, EHRI is unable to give a full and up-to-date account of the available literature here. However, it is important to highlight the 16 volume series *Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der europ\u00e4ischen Juden durch das nationalsozialistische Deutschland 1933-1945*, which is being published by EHRI-partner Institute for Contemporary History Munich-Berlin [Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte M\u00fcnchen-Berlin, IfZ] and Bundesarchiv, especially volumes 4 and 9, and 10. All volumes contain introductions based on international research literature and (as of 2024) are being translated into English (pmj-documents.org). Furthermore, the *Jewish History Quarterly* [*Kwartalnik Historii \u017byd\u00f3w*], which is published by the Warsaw-based Emanuel Ringelblum Jewish Historical Institute [\u017bydowski Institut Historyczny im. Emanuela Ringelbluma, \u017bIH] and the periodical \u201cZag\u0142ada \u017byd\u00f3w\u201d are probably the most reliable periodicals on current Holocaust research on Poland.\r\n\r\nEHRI has also relied on the following archival guides:\r\n- [1998-2011] J\u00f3\u017awik, Marek (eds.), *Relacje z czas\u00f3w zag\u0142ady - inwentarz / Holocaust survivors testimonies catalogue*, Archiwum \u017bIH - INB, zesp\u00f3\u0142 301 (Warsaw, Instytut Naukowo-Badawczy, 1998-2011)\r\n- [2009] Bednarek, Jerzy & Rafa\u0142 Le\u015bkiewicz (eds.), *Informator o zasobie archiwalnym Instytutu Pami\u0119ci Narodowej* (stan na dzie\u0144 31 grudnia 2008 roku) (Warszawa: IPN, 2009)\r\n- [2009] Shapiro, Robert Moses and Epsztein, Tadeusz, *The Warsaw Ghetto Oyneg Shabes-Ringelblum Archive, catalog and guide*, Bloomington, IN (Indiana Univ.

Characteristics of Poland\u2019s archival situation and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nUntil around 1990, the Polish state archival system imitated Soviet structures, which involved strong tendencies towards centralisation and almost complete inaccessibility. The network of Polish state archives opened up only after the crumbling of the Soviet bloc and the fall of communism in Poland. Since then, the network of state archives has functioned under the Head Office of State Archives [Naczelna Dyrekcja Archiw\u00f3w Pa\u0144stwowych, NDAP].\r\n\r\nIn addition to the NDAP network, there is the Institute of National Remembrance [Instytut Pami\u0119ci Narodowej, IPN] which was created in 1998 as a successor organisation to the Main Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes [G\u0142\u00f3wna Komisja Badania Zbrodni Hitlerowskich]. As the name suggests, it stores mainly documents on Nazi Crimes transferred from state archives, but also increasingly state security service files from the post-war period.\r\n\r\nOutside of the state archival and IPN networks, there is a wide range of archival institutions which hold Holocaust-relevant collections. There is, of course, the Jewish Historical Institute [\u017bydowski Instytut Historyczny, \u017bIH] in Warsaw, which deserves a special mention as a key institution for Holocaust research on Poland and beyond, but also the network of church archives throughout Poland, and various archives of central administrative institutions, such as the Central Statistical Office [G\u0142\u00f3wny Urz\u0105d Statystyczny, GUS]. The Archive of the Polish Red Cross also deserves to be mentioned. Finally, there are a number of state museums which were created in former German concentration camps (most importantly in Auschwitz, but also Majdanek) which hold, to a certain extent, archival material relevant for Holocaust research on Poland. A number of private institutions are also likely to hold Holocaust-relevant sources; important private research centres are \u201cKarta\u201d in Warsaw and Brama Grodzka in Lublin.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Poland**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Poland**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified over 100 archival institutions in Poland which hold or may hold Holocaust-relevant collections. At this point, it appears that a number of state archives which exist in all the major cities and in some regional centres throughout the country hold the most extensive Holocaust-relevant collections. The Central Archives of Modern Records [Archiwum Akt Nowych, AAN] in Warsaw and the local state archives hold essential collections concerning the German occupation in Poland, sources produced by the Polish resistance movement, but also documents created in the numerous ghettos in occupied Poland. In this regard, the State Archive in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a deserves a special mention, as it holds the archive of the Litzmannstadt ghetto. The Warsaw-based Jewish Historical Institute (\u017bIH) stores the underground archive of the Warsaw ghetto (Ringelblum Archive), a key collection to Holocaust research in Poland. The \u017bIH\u2019s collections of testimonies and memoirs which were written and recorded after the war cover all of occupied Poland, including its former eastern territories (today Belarus, Lithuania and Ukraine), and even Germany, as former inmates of German camps and forced labourers in Germany left their testimonies at the Institute as well. In terms of the sheer quantity of sources, the collections described by EHRI in the state archives of Bydgoszcz, Lublin, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Pozna\u0144 and Warsaw appear to be the most significant ones so far. Obviously, the somewhat smaller archival holdings identified elsewhere in Poland archives are not necessarily less important.\r\n\r\nThe collection descriptions in EHRI have been added from the archives\u2019 databases (in Polish), combined with the English information in the Skibi\u0144ska guide.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nAlina Skibi\u0144ska\u2019s *Guide to the Sources on the Holocaust in Occupied Poland* (Translated and expanded edition of the original Polish *\u0179r\u00f3d\u0142a do bada\u0144 nad zag\u0142ad\u0105 \u017byd\u00f3w na okupowanych ziemiach polskich* by Alina Skibi\u0144ska, Warsaw, 2007), European Holocaust Research Infrastructure, 2014, https://training.ehri-project.eu/sites/training/files/portal_assets/skibinska_guide.pdf includes information on sources on Poland held at repositories in Germany, Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States."

EHRI approach to Romania: Pre-existing research and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Romania, EHRI could rely on a number of pre-existing works. They are specifically devoted to the Holocaust in Romania, and also to the Holocaust in Bessarabia and Transnistria. These works include the following document editions and monographs: Matatias Carp, *Cartea neagr\u0103. Fapte \u015fi documente.

EHRI has also relied on third parties that had previously carried out survey and copying work, such as the USHMM and Yad Vashem.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Romania's archival system**\r\n\r\nRomania has a centralized archival system with the National Archives of Romania [Arhivele Na\u0163ionale ale Rom\u00e2niei, NAR] in charge of the State archival system. The state archives are made up of one major archive in Bucharest and multiple county branch archives. Several other state archives have their own archival system and collections. These include the Military National Archives of Romania, the Diplomatic Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Council for the Study of Securitate Archives.\r\n\r\nAccess to data in the NAR benefited from a protocol signed between NAR and the EHRI partner in Romania, the \u2018Elie Wiesel\u2019 National Institute for the Study of Holocaust in Romania. Access to data in the Military Archives was done via the Elie Wiesel Institute archival database.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Romania**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Romania**\r\n\r\nIn Romania, EHRI has identified several archival institutions which hold documents on Romania, Bessarabia, Bukovina and Transnistria. For these institutions, EHRI has made over 1,000 Holocaust-relevant archival descriptions available. In the NAR, EHRI identified documents on actions of the Jewish Central Office in Romania, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Work, Health and Social Protection, Presidency of the Council of Ministers. These collections cover administrative, political and judicial orders, decisions, reports, issued by Romanian authorities related to administration in Romania, Bessarabia, Bukovina and Transnistria. In the Military Archives, EHRI identified documents concerning military decisions mainly covering the Romanian governorates in Bessarabia, Bukovina Transnistria.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Romania, EHRI was able to identify vast Holocaust-relevant collections at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, which holds numerous selected records from various Romanian archives, institutions, organisations and individuals pertaining to the Holocaust period. They contain important source material produced by central government bodies, military and civilian authorities. Furthermore, Yad Vashem possesses important Holocaust-relevant material on Romania, such as the Wilhelm Filderman Archive: Chairman of the Federation of Jewish Communities in Romania, 1924-1947, and the Romanian Collection, which contains documentation on the history of Romanian Jews during the Holocaust period. Due Romania\u2019s expansion into Soviet territory during the Second World War, vast collections of Holocaust-relevant sources regarding Romania could also be identified in Ukraine, especially at the State Archives of the Odessa and Mykolaiv Oblasts, and in Moldova."

EHRI approach to Serbia: Pre-existing research, third-party surveys and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Serbia, EHRI could rely on a number of pre-existing works on the Holocaust in Serbia. Some important websites that are also very useful for locating the historical sources include:\r\n- killingsites.org: a website about the killing sites around Belgrade where the Jews were shot in 1941. The website is the result of an international project and there are several archival documents available.\r\n- holokaust.arhiv-beograda.org: a website about the victims of the Sajmiste concentration camp with a list of victims and archival documents from the Historical Archive of Belgrade.\r\n- topovskesupe.rs: a website for the Mapping the Holocaust \u2013 The Topovske \u0160upe Camp project, which aims to present a digitized history of the Topovske \u0160upe camp to the public.

The material is arranged and processed following geographical and thematic sets. Many documents are copies from the Freiburg Military Archives.\r\n\r\n- *Serbian Government of Milan Nedic 1941-1945 fond*\r\n\r\nAccess to the military archive is very limited for non-Serbian citizens and they have to follow a particular procedure for obtaining the permission to conduct research in the Military Archives.\r\n\r\n*Archives of Yugoslavia*\r\n\r\n- *The State Commission for the Investigation of the Crimes of Occupiers and their Supporters fond*\r\n\r\nThe fonds contains strictly classified, original documents of the Nazi occupiers and their local fascist allies, as well as testimonies and inquiries conducted by Yugoslav authorities immediately after the war in order to record all the crimes committed against civilians in Yugoslavia and seek out and prosecute those responsible.\r\n\r\n- *The Royal Yugoslav Government-in-exile*\r\n\r\nDocuments on the Holocaust can also be found in this fonds. Many of these documents are reports which were sent from occupied Yugoslavia to the Royal Yugoslav Government in London.\r\n\r\n*The Historical Archives of Belgrade*\r\n\r\n- *Commander of Security Police and Security Services BdS/Befehlshaber der Sicherheitspolizei und des Sicherheitsdienstes fond*\r\n\r\nIn this fonds, there is a focus on Gestapo documents, particularly personal dossiers, and it is considered one of the few intact Gestapo document collections in all of Europe.\r\n\r\n- *Belgrade City Administration fond*\r\n\r\nDragi Jovanovic\u0301, president of the Administration of the City of Belgrade, was one of the most reliable allies of the Nazi occupiers. The Special Police operated under his command, and in particular, the Police Department for Jews and Gypsies, which played an active role in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\n- *The Municipality of Belgrade fond*\r\n\r\nThe Municipality of Belgrade was in charge of administering the city. For this reason, this fonds contains materials concerning daily life in Belgrade during the Second World War.\r\n\r\n*The Jewish Historical Museum of Belgrade*\r\n\r\nEven though the Jewish Historical Museum does not have a particularly large collection dedicated to the Holocaust (the material mostly consists of copies from other archives), some interesting documents, such as the survivors\u2019 testimonies, are very useful.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Serbia**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Serbia**\r\n\r\nEHRI identified several Holocaust repositories in Serbia and focused on four of the most relevant: the Archives of Yugoslavia, the Military Archive, the Historical Archive of Belgrade and the Jewish Historical Museum. \r\nDuring the research survey multiple fonds were selected and hundreds of documents were consulted and described. Approximately, these fonds represent more than 80% of the available documents in Serbia covering the Holocaust in German-occupied Serbia. They cover other topics as well, including the flight of Jews from Serbia and the Independent State of Croatia to the Italian controlled territories, the killing of the Jews from Ba\u010dka under Hungarian occupation in the Bor copper mines, and the crimes in the Independent State of Croatia.\r\n\r\nLocal archives preserve information about the small Jewish communities in other cities (Ni\u0161, Kragujevac, Sabac and others), while the Archives of Vojvodina preserve documents that are primarily concerned with the killing of the Jews from Novi Sad and the Ba\u010dka region under Hungarian, and later Nazi, control. Also located in Novi Sad, the Museum of Vojvodina\u2019s Holocaust-relevant holdings have been described in the EHRI Portal.\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nEven though a detailed survey of archives outside of Serbia has not yet been conducted, we note that documents related to the Holocaust in Serbia are preserved in German repositories, such as the Bundesarchiv and the Arolsen Archives. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has also collected many relevant documents, while the Russian State Military Archive should hold the records of the Serbian Jewish communities before and during WWII."

The selection of described collections was also based on the results of a joint survey of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Yad Vashem.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Russia\u2019s archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe senior authority in the archival system of Russia is the Federal Archival Agency [Rosarkhiv]. Only the federal archives are under its actual authority. In other words, only the archives situated in Moscow, such as State Archives of the Russian Federation (GARF), the Russian State Archives of Socio-Political History (RGASPI), and others. There are also ministerial archives, which are not subject to the authority of Rosarkhiv. Important examples include the Central Archive of the Russian Defence Ministry (TsAMO) and the archives of the security services. The Regional Archives are only partially subordinated to the Rosarkhiv as they largely depend on the local authorities.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Russia**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Russia**\r\n\r\nImportant Holocaust-related collections at the State Archives of the Russian Federation (GARF) include the files of the Extraordinary State Committee to Investigate German Fascist Crimes Committed on Soviet Territory, the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee files as well as the Nuremberg Collection. The Russian State Archives of Socio-Political History (RGASPI) most importantly holds the files of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the General Headquarters of the Partisans in the Soviet Union, which contain reports on the occupied areas. Similar reports from the Red Army Main Political Directorate (GLAVPUR) records can be found at the Central Archive of the Russian Defence Ministry (TsAMO), which also houses captured \u201ctrophy\u201d documents mostly of German provenance. The Russian State Military Archive (RGVA) houses a large number of similarly captured collections. Regional archives hold local files generated by the abovementioned Extraordinary Commission as well as material from local occupation administrations.\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified over 50 archival institutions which hold or are likely to hold Holocaust-relevant material in Russia. A dozen of them are concentrated in Moscow. Three more are located in cities near Moscow: Podolsk, Domodedovo and Krasnogorsk. A smaller cluster of relevant archival institutions is located in or near St. Petersburg. EHRI has also found that 14 other cities of the Russian Federation, mostly regional capitals or capitals of autonomous member-republics, have one State Archive and one Contemporary History Archive, which stems back to a former Communist Party Archive. EHRI has managed to provide collections descriptions for a number of these archives, which are located in Belgorod, Kaliningrad, Kaluga, Krasnodar, Kursk, Nalchik, Pskov, Rostov, Smolensk, Stavropol, Tula, Tver, Volgograd, Voronezh. EHRI has also identified and, in some cases, described collections in archival institutions in the following cities: Bryansk, Birobidzhan, Cherkessk, Elista, Maykop, Novgorod, Orel, Penza, Taganrog, Ust-Labinsk, Yeysk.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Russia, EHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections that are relevant to Holocaust research on Russia. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, for instance, holds selected records from a number of Russian Federation archives, both capital and regional. In Israel, Yad Vashem also holds significant documentation from archives in Russia and a huge quantity of sources pertaining to Jewish individuals and/or groups during the Holocaust period.\r\n"

EHRI approach to Slovakia: Pre-existing research, available archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Slovakia, EHRI could rely on the general finding aids available at the archives in Slovakia itself. Third party surveys on Holocaust-relates sources, such as the ones carried out by USHMM, were very helpful as well.  \r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Slovakia's archival system** \r\n\r\nSlovakia exhibits a centralized archival system in which the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak republic is in charge of the State archival system. The state archives are made up of the Slovak National Archive [Slovensk\u00fd n\u00e1rodn\u00fd arch\u00edv] in Bratislava as well as several regional State archives [\u0160t\u00e1tny arch\u00edv v Bratislave, \u0160t\u00e1tny arch\u00edv v Ko\u0161iciach, \u0160t\u00e1tny arch\u00edv v Pre\u0161ove etc.] seated in county cities with their multiple branch archives (Workplace Archive) seated in district towns. Several other state archives and institutions have their own archival system and collections such as the Military History Archives [Vojensk\u00fd historick\u00fd arch\u00edv], the Slovak National Museum Archive [Arch\u00edv Slovensk\u00e9ho n\u00e1rodn\u00e9ho m\u00fazea] and Archive of the Museum of the Slovak National Uprising [M\u00fazeum Slovensk\u00e9ho n\u00e1rodn\u00e9ho povstania].\r\nIn terms of access to state archival system, EHRI benefited from the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Ministry of Interior and the EHRI partner in Slovakia, the Holocaust Documentation Center. \r\nThe access to other state-funded archives was organized individually. Besides the state-funded collection holding institutions, EHRI also identified and integrated into the EHRI portal data on collections of two NGOs: Nad\u00e1cia Milana \u0160ime\u010dku [Milan \u0160ime\u010dka Foundation] and the Holocaust Documentation Center which is also the EHRI partner in Slovakia. \r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results in Slovakia**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Slovakia**\r\n\r\nIn Slovakia, EHRI has identified several archival institutions which hold documents on Slovakia and the territory that was annexed by Hungary for the 1938-1945 period. For these institutions, EHRI has made over 150 top-level relevant archival descriptions available. In the Slovak National Archive, EHRI identified important fonds for the study of Slovakia\u2019s Holocaust history, including the holdings of the Ministry of Interior, Central Economic Office, the Office of the President of the Slovak Republic, the Bureau of the Prime Minister\u00b4s Office of the Slovak Republic etc. These archival fonds cover the most important political decisions, administrative orders and reports issued by the Slovak authorities towards Jews and Roma in Slovakia in 1938-1945. In various regional state archives in Slovakia EHRI identified important archival fonds of Slovak and Hungarian state administration bodies and security forces active in the territory of Slovakia (1938-1945) and in the territories annexed by Hungary. \r\nEHRI also identified a significant number of Holocaust-relevant archival fonds created by retribution courts after 1945 (National Court, District People\u00b4s Courts, People\u00b4s Courts) all over Slovakia.\r\nIn the Military History Archives EHRI identified documents concerning military decisions covering mainly military forced labour of Jews. \r\n\r\nC.II. In other countries\r\n\r\nEHRI identified Holocaust-relevant sources on Slovakia outside of the country in several institutions, such as Beit Theresienstadt or the Jewish Museum in Prague. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum holds selected records from the Slovak National Archive and regional state archives, Slovak armed forces as well as numerous oral history interviews. Yad Vashem possesses a number of collections that are relevant to Holocaust-research on Slovakia. The Political Archive of the German Foreign Office and the Bundesarchiv also hold Holocaust-relevant records on Slovakia, for instance on the SD Slowakei. "
