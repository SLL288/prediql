However, rising numbers of Jewish refugees contributed to the tightening of immigration laws in 1938. Shortly before the start of the Second World War, the Argentinian government sent a secret circular to its consuls in Europe ordering them to deny visas to Jewish applicants. The impact was significant; between 1933 and 1943, only 24,000 Jewish refugees were officially admitted into the country, while 20,000 Jews entered Argentina illegally. According to the census of 1947, there was a Jewish population of 249,330 out of a total population of 15,893,827. \r\n\r\nArgentina had and has a small Roma population.

              "history": "Austria was occupied and annexed by the German Reich in March 1938. Many Austrians welcomed this “Anschluss”, after which they were treated as Germans. On April 10, 1938, the “Act on the Reunification of Austria with the German Reich” was recognized by a referendum. Austria was integrated into the general administration of the German Reich and subdivided into seven Reichsgaue in 1939. In 1945, the Red Army took Vienna and eastern parts of the country, while the Western Allies occupied the western and southern sections.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Austria had a total population of about 6,753,000 people. After the “Anschluss” [annexation], 206,000 of them, including refugees from Germany, were persecuted as Jews under the Nuremberg Laws. The Austrian Nazi Party, which had been outlawed before the “Anschluss”, however, did not target only the Jews, but also other ethnic, social and political groups, such as the Roma, their political opponents, the disabled, “anti-social elements”, and others. In the process, Austrians became involved in all types of Nazi crimes. In the first days and weeks of Nazi rule, Jews were subjected to brutal outbreaks of violence, including theft and murder. Subsequently, most Jews in the provinces were forced to move to Vienna or abroad. The “Zentralstelle für jüdische Auswanderung in Wien” (“Central Office for Jewish Emigration in Vienna”), founded by the SS in August 1938, not only served as a model for the organisation of the expulsions, but also for the mass deportations from October 1939 onwards. Similar institutions were founded in Berlin, Prague, and Amsterdam. After the November pogroms in 1938, about 6,500 mostly male Jews from Austria were imprisoned, and 4,000 among them were sent to the Dachau concentration camp. By the beginning of the war in September 1939 about 130,000 Jews fled from Austria. During the war, the remaining Jews in Austria were subjected to ever increasing isolation by new regulations, including forced transferal to smaller quarters and the introduction of the obligatory Jewish Star in 1941. Austrian Jews were deported to ghettos, concentration and extermination camps, among others to Nisko, Kielce, Opole, Theresienstadt/Terezín, Litzmannstadt/Łódź, Riga, Maly Trostinez/Maly Trascianiec and Auschwitz-Birkenau. In May / June 1944, Jewish prisoners, mostly from Hungary, were moved to camps in Austria, particularly to the Mauthausen concentration camp complex and forced labour camps along the Eastern border. Especially in March and April 1945 thousands of them died on death marches. Overall, around 66,000 Austrian Jews perished in the Holocaust. \r\n\r\nThere were about 11,000 Roma living in Austria before the war. They were subject to harsh racist campaigns throughout the first decades of the 1900s. Shortly after the “Anschluss” in March 1938, Roma and Sinti were deprived of their rights as citizens and several hundred were deported to concentration camps. Since 1939, many detention camps (so-called “Zigeunerlager” [“Gypsy Camps”]) were erected in several places all over Austria. The largest camp was Lackenbach, which held around 4,000 Roma from the Burgenland. In November 1941, 5007 Austrian Roma were deported to the ghetto in Litzmannstadt. No one survived: They died in the ghetto or were murdered in Kulmhof. Since March 1943, Sinti and Roma were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Of the estimated 11,000 pre-war Roma, Sinti and Lovara population who were Austrian citizens in 1938, only 1,500 to 2,000 survived. "

When the Nazis took power in Germany in 1933, many German Jews migrated to Australia. The Australian government was initially hesitant in permitting entry to many Jews, but in 1938, it allotted 15,000 visas to “victims of oppression”. Some 7,000 Jews were able to obtain these visas before the outbreak of the Second World War put an end to the program. Jews from Germany were interned as enemy aliens from the start of the war until 1942. In the aftermath of the Second World War, Australia gradually abandoned its previous Anglo-centric immigration policy and permitted immigration of some European Jews who were survivors of the Holocaust. In 1939, Australia had a population of 6,935,000.\r\n\r\nFor this country there are no sufficient findings on the history of Roma during the Second World War.

              "history": "Annexed by Austria-Hungary in 1908, Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of Yugoslavia between the world wars. In April 1941, when Germany’s twelve-day campaign against Yugoslavia led to its partition between the Axis powers and their allies, Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of the Independent State of Croatia [Nezavisna Država Hrvatska, NDH], founded on 10 April 1941. While the Ustaše movement and its leader (Poglavnik), Ante Pavelić, assumed authority, the new state depended on German and Italian support. The Independent State of Croatia effectively ceased to exist in May 1945. Bosnia and Herzegovina became one of the six republics within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It declared independence in 1992.\r\n\r\nBefore the Second World War, Bosnia and Herzegovina had a total population of 2.5 million inhabitants. Of this population, about 14,500 were Jews spread throughout some 20 Jewish communities. Between 1933 and 1940, this number greatly increased as some 55,000 Jews from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia fled through the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Only 4,000 of these Jews remained in April 1941. The Ustaše movement implemented a policy of discrimination, expropriation and mass murder against Serbs, Roma, communists, and Jews. The Independent State of Croatia established a number of camps. In 1941, deportation of Jews began to concentration camps in Gospić, Jadovno, Jasenovac, Stara Gradiška, Đakovo, Loborgrad and others, and in 1942, to Auschwitz. Concentration camps claimed the lives of almost 80 % of Jews from Bosnia and Herzegovina. About 10,000 members of the pre-war Bosnian Jewish population had been murdered by 1945.\r\n\r\nAt least around 4,000 Roma lived on the eve of the Second World War in the territories of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina. The pro-fascist Ustasha movement led a genocidal policy towards the Roma in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Part of the Muslim intellectual and religious community claimed that 'White Gypsies' (Muslim sedentary Roma) must be considered as an integral part of the Muslim community ('Aryans') and therefore be spared from persecution. Such views and demands were published in May 1942 in the 'Zenica Resolution' which was accepted by the Ustasha authorities. A significant part of the rest of the Roma community was persecuted mostly through deportation to camps (especially the Jasenovac camp), where they were tortured and killed. Some Roma joined the anti-fascist partisan resistance movement. Despite some Muslim Roma being rescued during the war, the Roma community was still devastated. In the census of 1948, there were only 442 Roma identified."

              "history": "Belgium was invaded by German forces on 10 May 1940 and surrendered on 28 May under the orders of King Leopold III. The King stayed in Belgium, but the Prime Minister and many cabinet members fled to London, where they set up a government-in-exile. The German occupiers formed a military administration (for Belgium and Northern France), led by Alexander von Falkenhausen, which was replaced by a civilian administration in July 1944. Belgium was liberated in September of that year, although the fighting and bombing continued in parts of the country until May 1945.\r\n\r\nDuring the occupation, German orders resulted in the registration of about 57,000 Jews in Belgium, out of a total Belgian population of over 8 million. Of those Jews, 10 percent at the most were Belgian citizens; the others were mostly recent immigrants from Eastern and Central Europe. Over 90 percent of the Jewish population resided in Brussels and Antwerp. Shortly after the German invasion, the Belgian government arrested a few thousand German (and Austrian) nationals, including Jews, and sent them to camps in France. The Jews among them were later included in the deportations from France. Anti-Jewish legislation was first enacted in October 1940, while the economic plundering of the Jews began in May 1941. In April 1941, a pogrom took place in Antwerp, organized by local anti-Jewish organizations. In May 1942, the Yellow Star became obligatory. Then, in July 1942, Jews were summoned to the Dossin barracks [\"Sammellager Mechelen/Malines\"], a new transit camp in Mechelen (a city between Antwerp and Brussels) through an “Arbeitseinsatzbefehl” [“work order”]. In the summer of 1942, the German police forces and their collaborators actively started looking for Jews, with large raids taking place in Brussels and Antwerp. The deportations began on 4 August 1942 and lasted until 31 July 1944. A total of 28 convoys left the Dossin camp, mainly for Auschwitz, four convoys left for other camps: one to Ravensbrück-Buchenwald and Bergen-Belsen, and two to Vittel. Overall, 25,490 Jews arrested in Belgium and northern France were deported from Mechelen. The vast majority perished in the camps, approximately 1,700 survived.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War, a few hundred Sinti and Roma lived in Belgium. The Belgian’s Aliens Police particularly targeted Roma and Sinti in its activities to take action against those who were considered a threat to national security or public morals. On 21 December 1941 the Belgian Aliens Police introduced the so-called “Carte de Nomade / Zigeunerkaart” [“Gypsy Card”], a new identification card exclusively for Sinti and Roma. These temporary residence permits had to be renewed every three months and later served to track people down in raids and for deportations, which started in 1943. 352 Sinti and Roma, arrested in Belgium and Northern France were deported from the Dossin barracks [\"Sammellager Mechelen/Malines\"] on 15 January 1944 to Auschwitz-Birkenau. 10 individuals were deported there separately. 34 of them survived."

              "history": "Bulgaria joined the Axis alliance in March 1941 and entered the Second World War following Germany’s campaign against Yugoslavia and Greece in April 1941. Territories in both occupied countries came under Bulgarian military and civilian administration. Bulgaria’s involvement in the wars of the Axis, however, did not go any further. Bulgaria did not join Hitler’s war against the Soviet Union; it did not sever diplomatic ties with the Soviets. In August 1944, Bulgaria began to distance itself from the Axis. The government declared war on Germany on 8 September 1944, only to be overthrown by a communist coup one day later as the Red Army entered Bulgarian territory.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Second World War, Bulgaria had 6,341,000 inhabitants. Among them were some 48,000 Jews, most of whom lived in the capital Sofia. In January 1941, the pro-Nazi government, despite public opposition, introduced the antisemitic “Law for the Protection of the Nation” which put numerous restrictions on the country’s Jews. It was implemented by the specially created Commissariat for Jewish Affairs [Komisarstvo po Evreyskite Vuprosi, KEV]. After 1941, all Jewish men between 20 and 45 years of age were drafted for forced labour and mainly put to work building roads and railways. In February 1943, the head of the KEV, Alexander Belev, and the German SS-Plenipotentiary Theodor Dannecker signed an agreement for the deportation of 20,000 Jews from Bulgaria’s “new territories”, in Macedonia and Thrace. Since there were not enough Jews in these areas (slightly above 11,000) to reach this figure, the rest were to be taken from a number of towns in Bulgaria. 11,343 Macedonian and Thracian Jews were deported by Bulgarian and German authorities to Treblinka and murdered there in March 1943, but no Jews from Bulgaria proper. The Bulgarian government resumed planning to meet the German demands for the deportation of Jews from Bulgaria in May 1943 (which met with public protest). The Bulgarian Jews, except those who lived abroad under German occupation and were denied Bulgarian help, survived despite the hardship of the war years. Anti-Jewish laws were formally repealed in late August 1944. At the end of the war, 49,172 Jews lived within the old boundaries of Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nAccording to a 1934 census, there were 149,385 Roma living mostly in villages in Bulgaria. Roma communities were subject to discrimination, forced labour, and restricted movement. Roma living in Bulgarian occupied territories were subject to various kinds of persecution\r\n"

              "history": "The territory of what is present-day Belarus was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793. In January 1919, the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed. After the Polish-Soviet War of 1920, the western regions of Belarus, including the cities of Brest, Hrodna, Nowogródek (Navahrudak) and Pinsk, were incorporated into Poland, while the east remained part of the Soviet Union. Following the Ribbentrop-Molotov Agreement, the Red Army occupied eastern Poland in September 1939 and reclaimed previously lost territory. When German armies crossed the Soviet border on 22 June 1941, they seized the capital of the Belarusian Soviet Republic, Minsk, within a week. By September 1941, Germany controlled all of Belarus. The western part of the occupied Soviet Republic came under a civilian administration, while the east was administered by the military. The territory under civilian administration was divided between the White Ruthenia General District (the main portion of the territory) and the Lithuania General District (the north-western part), both subordinate to Reichskommissariat Ostland. Other areas were attached to Reichskommissariat Ukraine (in the South) and the Białystok District, which was attached to the German Gau East Prussia (in the North-West). The Red Army ended the German occupation of Belarus in August 1944. Belarus declared independence from the USSR in August 1991.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the German invasion, the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic had an estimated total population of 9,200,000 people. About 700,000 of them were Jews. According to various estimates, between 153,000 and 165,000 Jews from Belarus managed to flee or were evacuated when Germany invaded. The main perpetrators of the murder campaign were members of Einsatzgruppen A and B and the Security and Order Police stationed in Belarus. Most of the Jews in Belarus were exterminated in two major waves: between the late summer and winter of 1941 and during 1942. As the scope of mass murder widened, the Germans increasingly relied on local collaborators and collaborating organizations. The last Jewish ghettos in Western Belarus were liquidated in the summer of 1942, while the Minsk Ghetto, one of the largest in Europe, was fully liquidated by October 1943. The percentage of Jews who perished in Belarus during the Holocaust is among the highest in Europe. The number of victims has been estimated to be at least 450,000 and may be in the range of 600,000, including Jewish refugees from Poland. In Belarus, the Germans not only murdered Jews living in the country, but also Jews from the Reich or Bohemia who were deported or escaped to Belarus from all over Europe.\r\n\r\nRoma have had a presence in what is today Belarus since the 15th century. According to a Soviet census conducted in 1939, there were 3,362 Roma living in the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (BSSR). The actual number was higher because the western parts of Belarus belonged to Poland at the time (and no census data exists for this area) and some Roma were registered as Belarusians or Russians. Little is known about the history of Roma living in the western parts of Belarus under Soviet rule between September 1939 and June 1941. Under German occupation, Roma communities were subject to displacement, forced labour, and concentration. Most were killed on the spot in summary executions and mass shootings by both German soldiers and local collaborators. It is estimated that at least 3,000 Belorussian Roma were killed."

Canadian troops played an important role in the naval and air war against Germany. They participated in the Italy and Normandy campaigns and were involved in the liberation of concentration camps, notably Bergen-Belsen.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the war, Canada had a Jewish population of more than 150,000 people, out of a total population of approximately 11 million. Under the leadership of Liberal Prime Minister William Mackenzie King, the federal government set up highly restrictive and ethnically selective immigration policy. For the period 1933-1945, between 5,000 and 10,000 Jewish migrants were accepted into the country, many of whom arrived before the war started. During the war, the arrivals were very limited; some 2,000 German and Austrian Jewish “enemy aliens” were transported from Great Britain and interned in Canada, and 400 refugees came from Spain and Portugal in 1944. Conversely, after the war, Holocaust survivors became one of the immediate post-war era’s largest migrant categories: From 1947 to 1955, 35,000 of them resettled in Canada. \r\n\r\nFor this country there are no sufficient findings on the history of Roma during the Second World War.

              "history": "When Germany invaded Poland, the Swiss Federal Council called for general mobilisation and formally declared neutrality. The Parliament elected a war-time commander-in-chief of the army who, along with the Federal Council, issued joint orders to resist any invader in April 1940. German plans to outflank the French through Swiss territory were dismissed. While Switzerland enjoyed the double advantage of being a secondary objective for the Axis powers and of being able to deter attackers thanks to difficult terrain and quite a formidable military force, the country found itself effectively surrounded by Axis territory after the fall of France. The last remaining exit was closed off after the German occupation of Vichy France in November 1942. Switzerland maintained armed neutrality throughout the Second World War.\r\n\r\nBefore the war, Switzerland had a total population of about 4,066,400 people. Some 19,000 of them were Jews (half Swiss, half foreign-born). While Switzerland provided asylum to political refugees from Germany after 1933, Swiss authorities did not consider “racial” persecution a valid reason for asylum. While some 30,000 Jewish refugees who reached Switzerland during the war were admitted, approximately the same number was turned back at the border. At the end of the war, as part of efforts to aid concentration camp prisoners, Switzerland accepted transports of Jewish prisoners from various camps, including Bergen-Belsen, Theresienstadt and Buchenwald.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland imposed several anti-Roma policies prior to the First World War such as prohibiting Sinti and Roma from traveling by rail or boat, a ban on entering the country, and identification through an official registry. During the Second World War, refugees of the minority were returned to Nazi Germany or imprisoned while awaiting expulsion. Those who were already Swiss residents faced forced sterilization and abortions. The 1906 ban on Romani people entering Switzerland was lifted in 1972."

              "history": "The Bohemian lands (Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia) were part of the Habsburg monarchy until the First World War, and of the First Czechoslovak Republic between 1918 and 1938. Following the signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938, the border territories along the nowadays German and Austrian frontier were annexed by Germany (and a small part of Silesia by Poland). Most of these areas were reorganized as the Reichsgau Sudetenland, while areas in the West and South were attached to neighboring German Gaue. Further territorial losses between September and November 1938, led to the federalisation of Czechoslovakia (Czecho-Slovakia). In March 1939 Nazi Germany occupied the rest of the Bohemian lands, creating the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, with its own government and administration under close German supervision. The German-occupied Protectorate functioned up to the end of the war in May 1945.\r\n\r\nIn 1939, the Bohemian lands had a total population of about 11 million inhabitants (10,674,386 according to the 1930 census). After the Munich Agreement, most of the approximately 25,000 Jews from Sudetenland escaped or were expelled into the interior of the country. In the Protectorate, the occupiers regarded some 118,000 inhabitants as Jews. This Jewish community had modernized and had largely assimilated with German and Czech society in the Bohemian lands. In the context of rising nationalism and antisemitism, the first exclusionary measures were already taken during the Second Republic (1938-39). After the occupation, the Germans, as well as the semi-autonomous authorities of the Protectorate, imposed laws and various ordinances to discriminate against Jews and confiscate their property. In autumn 1939, some 5,000 Jews were deported from Vienna and Ostrava to Nisko. Before further emigration was banned in 1941, 26,000 Jews emigrated legally and several more illegally from the Protectorate. In 1941-42 several thousand Jews were deported to the ghettos of Litzmannstadt, Riga and Minsk, where they shared the history of the local Jewish population. In November 1941 the Theresienstadt [Terezín] ghetto was created; over 80,000 Jews from the Bohemian lands, but also more than 60,000 from Germany, Austria, and other Nazi-controlled territories were deported there between 1942 and 1945. Theresienstadt became a transit ghetto, because most of the prisoners were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau and other extermination camps. About 33,000 Theresienstadt (mostly elderly) inmates perished in the ghetto due to the harsh conditions. In 1943-44, approximately 17,500 prisoners were deported to the Theresienstadt Family Camp in Auschwitz-Birkenau which was probably created for propaganda purposes. Most of the prisoners were killed in two large actions. At the end of the war there were 2,800 Jews in the Bohemian lands (most of them from “mixed” families), but the number of survivors was larger (about 14,000, together with the surviving deportees). Altogether, about 80,000 Czech Jews perished in the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nDuring the interwar period, approximately 70–100,000 Roma lived in the territories of the whole Czechoslovak Republic. The vast majority lived in Slovakia. After the Anschluss in 1938, anti-Roma sentiment radicalized, and the population faced increasing discrimination. After the establishment of the Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia in 1939, legislation and praxis towards Roma and Sinti was adjusted to the regulations already valid in Germany. Around 6,500 Roma were racially categorised by official authorities, many were deported into the detention camps Lety near Pisek and Hodonin near Kunstadt and later deported to Auschwitz. The Roma population in Bohemia and Moravia was almost completely destroyed. "

At the same time as EHRI had started its identification and investigation work, the National Archives of Belgium commenced a project which aimed to produce a guide to sources on Jewish life in Belgium. EHRI closely cooperated with this project’s directors and researchers. The identification of repositories holding Holocaust-related collections dramatically improved thanks to this collaborative identification work. \r\n\r\nOne of the most important Belgian archives for Holocaust research is Kazerne Dossin: Memorial, Museum and Research Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights. This museum and research centre actively collects material, often private collections, about the Holocaust in Belgium. It holds the largest collection of materials on the topic in Belgium, including original, photocopied and scanned materials. EHRI supported Kazerne Dossin by helping them transfer the existing texts into archival descriptions according to international archival standards and integrating new descriptions into this system. This resulted in a major step forward for Kazerne Dossin: from 17 collection descriptions, Kazerne Dossin now provides EHRI with hundreds of descriptions. It is continuing this effort in order to make all its materials publicly available on a collection level.\r\n\r\nMade up of the National Archives, 17 State Archives in the Provinces, the Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (CEGESOMA); and the Directorate-General for War Victims, the State Archives are another significant institution that hold Holocaust-related material. In particular, the National Archives branch in Brussels conserve the archive of the former Military Justice system, which includes all the post-war trial records. Some important city (and communal) archives also have Holocaust-related material, such as those of Brussels, Antwerp, Liège, Charleroi and Ghent. Moreover, EHRI has worked closely CEGESOMA. Collection descriptions from the Centre were selected via key-word selection and literature search (verification of bibliographies of key works on the Holocaust in Belgium) and integrated onto the Portal by EHRI. This export includes archival documents, manuscripts, interview descriptions, and photo descriptions. As for the Directorate-General for War Victims, it possesses one of the largest and most important collections on the Holocaust in Belgium from the victims’ perspective.\r\n\r\nThere are also several important private archival institutions in Belgium. Notably, the Jewish Museum of Belgium in Brussels, which holds important sources related to the victims, as do some remembrance organisations, such as the Auschwitz Foundation and the Foundation of Contemporary Memory, which collect testimonies.\r\n\r\nMany other sources are stored in repositories outside of Belgium. First of all, there are the archives of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (with branches in New York and Jerusalem) and the World Jewish Congress records on Belgium (stored at the Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati). The Yad Vashem archives hold both original and copied materials on Jews in Belgium, including the original documents of the Belgian Jewish Committee in London during the Second World War. Likewise, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum holds vast materials on Jews in Belgium, both originals and copies. Their copy collection on Belgium includes copies from Kazerne Dossin, the Directorate-General for War Victims, CEGESOMA, and the National Archives (Foreigners’ Police archives, Brüsseler Treuhandgesellschaft collection, Archive of the Diamond collection and other files). The USHMM’s original collections include the “Fela and Chaïm Perelman papers”. The extensive report on Belgium also includes references to publications on sources on Belgium stored in German and French archives (most notably, the German sources on Belgium kept at the French National Archives at Pierrefitte-sur-Seine, the sub-series AJ40, and those kept at the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv Freiburg)."

EHRI approach to Austria: Pre-existing research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Austria, EHRI could rely on a number of pre-existing works on the Holocaust. Highly useful for EHRI’s identification efforts was a general overview of archives in Austria, Germany and Switzerland:\r\n\r\n[2009] *Archive in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz. Ein Adressenverzeichnis* (Münster: Ardey, 2009). Book + CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n[2023] *Archive in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz. Adressenverzeichnis 2023/2024* (Münster: Ardey, 2023). Book + CD-ROM\r\n\r\nThe publications of the Austrian Historians’ Commission [Österreichische Historikerkommission], which are available and searchable online at http://www.boehlau.at/histkom, are also helpful. Furthermore, the following platform is an important and specifically Holocaust-relevant online resource:\r\n\r\nNS-Quellen\r\nThis resource is dedicated to issues of expropriation between 1938 and 1945, and to issues of restitution and compensation after 1945. The platform itself is an entry point. Researchers will find detailed information about resources that can provide them with valuable assistance in their research (for example: In which Austrian archives can I find documents on expropriation? Where can I conduct research on citizenship revocation?; or how? How can I find out whether a specific property or rental was “aryanised”?). The platform offers an overview of the legal foundations of both the Nazi expropriation of property as well as restitution and compensation from the Republic of Austria after 1945. It gives direct access to the original texts of all the laws relevant to this context. There are also bibliographic references and explanations of individual terms. The information is in German. See here: (http://ns-quellen.at)\r\n\r\nInformation about further digital resources and services in Austria can be found on the website of EHRI Austria: https://www.ehri.at/en/projects/ \r\n\r\nAmong the more traditional research tools, the following guide is worth mentioning:\r\n[1995, 1991] Boberach, Heinz (Ed.), *Inventar archivalischer Quellen des NS-Staates. Die Überlieferung von Behörden und Einrichtungen des Reichs, der Länder und der NSDAP*, 2 Teile, (Munich: Saur, 1991, 1995). Also included in the commercial database “Deutsche Geschichte im 20. Jahrhundert Online: Nationalsozialismus, Holocaust, Widerstand und Exil 1933-1945”, http://db.saur.de/DGO.\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Austrian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nAustria exhibits a highly differentiated archival system without much centralisation. In addition to the Federal Archives and its departments (governed by the Bundesarchivgesetz), each of the Austrian Bundesländer has its own State Archive (each governed by the respective state Archivgesetz or statute). There are over 50 city archives. The religious communities in Austria, first and foremost bodies and organisations of the Catholic Church, exhibit a rich array of archival institutions. University archives, archives of noble houses (in particular the Liechtenstein archives) and a number of other, mostly topical archives as well as libraries holding archival material also exist.\r\n\r\nKey institutions identified by EHRI include the Austrian State Archive (Österreichisches Staatsarchiv/ Archiv der Republik), which has an online search engine (http://www.archivinformationssystem.at/suchinfo.aspx), and the respective state archives of the Austrian Bundesländer, which hold surviving files of central and regional administrative bodies as well as post-war investigations. Likewise important are the state operated Archive of the Mauthausen Memorial, which contains files of the Mauthausen concentration camp complex; the Dokumentationsarchiv des Österreichischen Widerstandes (DÖW), which contains material from private hands as well as serving as a hub for highly pertinent copied files accrued from dozens of archives; the Archive of the Jewish Community Vienna (Archiv der IKG Wien), which contains the files of the Vienna Jewish community encompassing the vast majority of Austrian Jews; the Vienna Wiesenthal Institute; for Holocaust Studies (VWI); and the Forschungsstelle Nachkriegsjustiz, which has collected the scattered information on post-war trials for Nazi war crimes.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Austria**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Austria**\r\n\r\nIn Austria, EHRI has identified over 200 state, municipal and church archives. While well over 25% of these archives are clustered in or around Vienna, there are also important archives in all Austrian Bundesländer.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Austria, material relevant to the Holocaust in Austria can be found in a number of institutions, including the German Bundesarchiv and the Arolsen Archives in Germany, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University, Yad Vashem, the Central Archive of the Jewish People in Jerusalem, the Wiener Holocaust Library in London, the Leo Baeck Institute in Jerusalem, New York/Berlin, and London, the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam as well as the National Archives of Hungary and the Hungarian Jewish Archives in Budapest, the Historical Jewish Institute in Warsaw, and the Jewish Museum in Prague.

EHRI approach to Bosnia-Herzegovina: Pre-existing research, available archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nResearch conducted on the subject of the Holocaust in Bosnia and Herzegovina is still under development. In the last decade there has been some increase in research and interest in Holocaust-relevant sources, but mainly from outside the country (studies produced were either funded by the European Union or conducted by researchers from abroad). Sources that were particularly relevant to EHRI’s survey work include the following monographs: Anisa Hasanhnodžić, Rifet Rustemović, *After the traces of our neighbours: Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Holocaust* (Sarajevo: Institut za istoriju, 2015); Rusmir Agačević, *Snovopriče o Sefardima i Aškenazima travničkim* (Zagreb, 2013); Jakov Danon, Verica M.

EHRI also relied on dozens of written articles published in several journals (*Most, Baština sjeveroistočne Bosne, Jevrejski pregled, Jevrejski glas, Sefarad 92*, etc.), memoirs and previously conducted surveys and copies of relevant documentation performed by third parties, mainly by the USHMM, are also useful. EHRI has also identified a helpful guide which contains general information about Bosnian archives:\r\n\r\n- Bakaršić, Kemal, *Fragmenti kulturne historije Bosne i Hercegovine* (Sarajevo: Magistrat, 2005).\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s archival system**\r\n\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina has a heavily decentralized political structure that is reflected in its archival system as well. The central archival institution, the Archives of Bosnia-Herzegovina, is located in Sarajevo, the capital city. The majority of relevant records for Holocaust research are stored there, but the institution has no control over other archives in the country. There are two provincial (entity’s) archives, the “Archive of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina”, which does not hold Holocaust-related material, and “Archive of Republika Srpska,” which operate in their respective political entities, which were formed by the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995. Besides them, there is an archive in the District of Brčko. As with the Archive of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Brčko archives does not hold Holocaust-related material. The Archive of Republika Srpska has several branches, but it operates as a centralized institution, with headquarters in Banja Luka. Moreover, the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, besides having its archival institution, also has cantonal (county) archives. These archives operate in most of the cantons (Travnik, Široki Brijeg, Bihać, Mostar, Tuzla, Goražde, Sarajevo). However, these institutions are independent and work under their own, cantonal laws. This heavily decentralized archival system can sometimes be a hindrance to efficient research. It is also worth noting that most of the archives are still in development, which can further delay research and availability of records.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Bosnia and Herzegovina**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Bosnia and Herzegovina**\r\n\r\nEHRI has identified a number of archival institutions and other types of organisations which hold Holocaust-relevant documents and has described over 60 collections. The Archives of Bosnia-Herzegovina are the most important institution in possession of Holocaust-relevant material as they hold a vast collection from the Second World War period and from the Research Commission of Crimes Committed by Occupying Forces. Furthermore, the Jewish Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina [Muzej Jevreja Bosne i Hercegovine], which is a branch of the Museum of Sarajevo [Muzej Sarajevo], the Historical Archives Sarajevo [Historijski arhiv Sarajevo] and the archives of Jewish communities (Sarajevo, Doboj, Mostar and others) have documents that are relevant for Holocaust research. The collections and fonds of these institutions cover a broad range of documentation, but they mostly contain administrative, political and judicial documentation created by authorities (local or higher levels), organizations, military structures, etc.\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Bosnia and Herzegovina, EHRI was able to identify a significant number of Holocaust-related collections at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, which holds selected records from several Bosnian archives (Travnik, Tuzla, Sarajevo), individuals and communities. Relevant material can also be found in other former Yugoslav countries, namely, Serbia and Croatia. The Jewish Museum in Belgrade (Serbia) and the Croatian State Archives (in Zagreb) contain numerous collections related to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Jews and the Holocaust."

EHRI approach to Belgium: Pre-existing research and available archival guides**\r\n\r\nTwo official research projects, commissioned by the Belgian State, that have been carried out by CEGESOMA and others, have mapped a significant proportion of Holocaust-related archives in Belgium. The first project, conducted in 2001, was about the spoliation of Jewish assets during the war. The second, the results of which were published in 2007, investigated the possible responsibility of Belgian national and local authorities in the persecution of the Jews. The major publications resulting from these projects were:\r\n\r\n- *Les biens des victims des persécutions anti-juives en Belgique: spoliation, rétablissement des droits, résultats de la Commission d’étude. / De bezittingen van de slachtoffers van de jodenvervolging in België: spoliatie, rechtsherstel, bevindingen van de studiecommissie: eindverslag*, Brussels: Chancellery of the Prime Minister, July 2001\r\n\r\n- Rudi Van Doorslaer (dir), Emmanuel Debruyne, Frank Seberechts, Nico Wouters (a.l.p.d.

Lieven Saerens), *Gewillig België. Overheid en Jodenvervolging tijdens de Tweede Wereldoorlog*, Antwerpen/Brussel, Meulenhoff-Manteau/Soma, 2007, 1,163 p.\r\n\r\nAt the same time as EHRI had started its identification and investigation work, the National Archives of Belgium commenced a project which aimed to produce a guide to sources on Jewish life in Belgium. EHRI closely cooperated with the directors of the project at the National Archives and the two project researchers, Gertjan Desmet and Pascale Falek Alhadeff. The major publication resulting from this project was:\r\n\r\n- Pierre-Alain Tallier (dir.), Gertjan Desmet & Pascale Falek-Alhadeff, *Sources pour l'histoire des populations juives et du judaïsme en Belgique/Bronnen voor de geschiedenis van de Joden en het Jodendom in België, 19de-21ste eeuw*, Brussel, ARA-AGR/Avant-Propos, 2016, 1,328 p.\r\n\r\nBefore the publication of this guide, no such archival overview existed, although there were other synopses available that dealt with periodicals and publications on Jewish history (and in the case of the latter, indirectly shed light on certain primary sources, although its main focus was on secondary sources):\r\n\r\n- Zosa Szajkowski. “Bibliography of Jewish Periodicals in Belgium, 1841–1959”, *Studies in Bibliography and Booklore*, Vol. 4, No. 3 (June 1960), pp. 103-122 (Published by: Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion; Article Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/27943319).\r\n\r\n- Daniel Dratwa. *Répertoire des périodiques juifs parus en Belgique de 1841 à 1986*, Brussels: Pro Museo Judaico, 1987.\r\n\r\n- Barbara Dickschen — Jacques Déom — Catherine Massange — Jean-Philippe Schreiber, *Guide Bibliographique: Les Juifs en Belgique*, Brussels, Fondation de la Mémoire Contemporaine-Stichting Eigentijdse Herinnering, 2008 [updated version in 2014].\r\n\r\nIn addition to the works mentioned above, EHRI’s identification work relied on many other publications on the Holocaust in Belgium as well as other archival guides (none of which were entirely dedicated to Holocaust sources). For a general introduction to sources on Belgian contemporary history, see:\r\n\r\n- Patricia Van den Eeckhout & Guy Vanthemsche (eds.), *Bronnen voor de studie van het hedendaagse België, 19e-21e eeuw* (Brussels: Koninklijke Commissie voor Geschiedenis / Commission royale d'Histoire, 2017, 3rd revised edition).\r\n\r\nFor finding aids on sources on Belgium during the Second World War in German and French archives, see:\r\n\r\n- Stefan Martens & Sebastian Remus, *Frankreich und Belgien unter deutscher Besatzung 1940-1944; die Bestände des Bundesarchiv-Militärarchivs Freiburg* (Stuttgart: Jan Thorbecke Verlag, 2002).\r\n\r\n- Guy Beaujouan, Anne-Marie Bourgoin, Pierre Cézard, et.al., *La France et la Belgique sous l'occupation allemande, 1940-1944. Les fonds allemands conservés au Centre historique des Archives nationales. Inventaire de la sous-série AJ40* (Paris: Centre historique des Archives nationales, 2002).\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Belgian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nBelgium has a large number of repositories, considering the size of the country, and they are a mixture of public and private initiatives. This means researchers can sometimes find them hard to navigate. When looking for basic information about victims, local and national administrations are often in possession of personal files. The majority of Jews in Belgium were not Belgian nationals (less than 10 percent at the registration in 1940). For the non-naturalized legal residents the Belgian Foreigners’ Police kept personal or family files. These files are held in both local level institutions (the city administrations) and in the National Archives (central files). It is important to note that the Jewish communities in Belgium were concentrated in Brussels and Antwerp, and to a far lesser extent in Charleroi and Liège. Following the decree from 29 August 1942, Jews were only allowed to live in one of these four cities. But still there are interesting sources in other city archives. The case of the deportation of a few thousand Jews from Antwerp to communities in the adjacent province of Limburg at the end of 1940 illustrates this. They were allowed to return after a few months, but their stay obviously left traces in some of the local archives. These archives can be identified using (local) studies on this very specific subject, but these are very small archives with sometimes very limited collections on the Holocaust period. The foreigners’ files are accessible via name registers, organised according to date of arrival in Belgium. It should be noted that public administrations in Belgium were (and are still) not allowed to register ethnic or religious background. None of the official pre- or post-war sources therefore mention “Jew” or “Jewishness” (unlike in the neighbouring Netherlands, for example, where religion was duly registered).\r\n\r\nIndeed, this access via names – instead of, for example, by topic – poses one of the most important challenges to locating both victim and perpetrator sources in Belgium. Important victim sources are held by the Directorate-General War for Victims, a state institution, originally founded by the Ministry of Reconstruction and now part of the State Archives. Its task was to gather information on war victims in different military archives, judicial archives, etc., in order to obtain settlement and/or victim recognition. It thus built up a huge collection of personal files and files on some organisations, such as the Jewish resistance. There is no online catalogue, only a card index system which is not publicly accessible. It is alphabetically ordered, so one has to know the name of the person whose files he or she is looking for and there are no specific references to the persecution of the Jews. There is also an inventory, but using it does not resolve the issues mentioned above.\r\n\r\nSimilar problems arise in the case of one the most important archives for the study of the perpetrators. The archives of the former Military Justice system, which hold the files of the post-war trials of war criminals and collaborators, have been transferred to the National Archives but are not publicly accessible, consultation requiring the authorisation of the *Collège des procureurs généraux/College van procureurs-generaal*. Access is generally granted for researchers, the individuals concerned and their descendants. A research guide and summary finding aid exist.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Belgium**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Belgium**\r\n\r\nEHRI's identification and investigation work in Belgium was based on a three-pronged approach:\r\n\r\n1. Actively identifying repositories (and collections, in the case of CEGESOMA) via the bibliographies of key publications on the subject.\r\n\r\n2. Providing Kazerne Dossin – Memorial, Museum and Documentation Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights with know-how and assistance to provide shareable descriptions of its sources that meet international archival standards.\r\n\r\n3. Working closely together with the authors and directors of the research guide on *Sources pour l'histoire des populations juives et du judaïsme en Belgique/Bronnen voor de geschiedenis van de Joden en het Jodendom in België, 19de-21ste eeuw*\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the identification of repositories holding Holocaust-related collections was dramatically improved by EHRI’s identification work, both via its own identification work based on the abovementioned reference works and through cooperation with the National Archives and their research guide authors. At the start of EHRI, the Directory of Holocaust-Related Archives of the Claims Conference listed 7 Belgian archives while the *Guide éuropeen des sources d’archives de la Shoah* provided information on 9 repositories. EHRI's portal now contains information on over 120 repositories, most of them with detailed information.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the huge gap that had to be covered has much to do with the belated interest in Holocaust documentation and research in Belgium. CEGESOMA was created in the late 1960s, which is rather late compared to similar institutions in other countries, such as NIOD in the Netherlands. Moreover, although the persecution of Jews during the Second World War was always present both in the collections and in research, it was never a central focus point. This delayed interest was very much visible when EHRI started its activities. EHRI's activities coincided with the beginnings of a research guide to Jewish sources at the National Archives, and the opening of Kazerne Dossin, so the project started precisely at a time when the topic was finally receiving wide attention in Belgium from academic, archival and public perspectives.\r\n\r\n**_Identification of collections_**\r\n\r\n*Kazerne Dossin*\r\n\r\nDue to the aforementioned challenges, the first point of call of any research on the persecution of Jews in Belgium should be Kazerne Dossin. Kazerne Dossin was originally established in the mid-1990s as the Jewish Museum of Deportation and Resistance and was located in the former transit camp Dossin in Mechelen. This museum and research centre actively collects material, often private collections, related to the Holocaust in Belgium. It holds the largest collection of materials on the topic in Belgium, including original, photocopied and scanned materials. Often, Kazerne Dossin can offer easier access to originals kept elsewhere, as it has, first of all, such a wide variety of sources in one central place and, secondly, because its database can trace multiple sources on one person, thereby giving easy access to scanned foreigners’ files on victims of the Holocaust (whereas in the original archives one would have to go through the register and then request the file needed, or search for the correct microfilm) or other sources. Consulting these sources in the original repository, would require considerable effort in terms of administration and identification. Moreover, Kazerne Dossin keeps track of ongoing research and employs a team of experts in the field.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite the wealth of its sources, the archives of Kazerne Dossin remained relatively unknown to the outside world until 2015 because of the limited information available via finding aids. On its website, Kazerne Dossin originally only provided one text describing its main collections, which was regularly updated: The number of described collections fluctuated between 9 and 17 and the identifier numbers attached to the collection descriptions changed. Many of the materials – often precious private sources from victims or survivors, donated to the museum – remained hidden behind generic descriptions such as “Museum’s collection” or were only described in a separate Word document, stored in a folder together with the scans of the originals and only accessible to staff. EHRI supported Kazerne Dossin by helping them transfer the existing texts into archival descriptions according to international archival standards, and integrate new descriptions into this system. This resulted in a major step forward for Kazerne Dossin: the number of collection descriptions provided to EHRI rose from 17 to over 220 descriptions and Kazerne Dossin is continuing its efforts to make all its materials publicly available on a collection level. As one of the archivists stated: “It is only since EHRI came along that people here accepted the need to work according to international archival standards”.\r\n\r\n*CEGESOMA*\r\n\r\nThe Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (CEGESOMA) also holds important Holocaust collections, such as as the archives of the Devisenschutzkommando, the records of the trial against von Falkenhausen, the Tätigkeitsberichte of the Military Administration and important files from the former Military Prosecutor's Office. Collection descriptions from CEGESOMA were selected via keyword selection and literature search (verification of bibliographies of key works on the Holocaust in Belgium) and integrated by EHRI's IT specialists. The export includes archival documents, manuscripts, interview descriptions, and photo descriptions.\r\n\r\n*Sources pour l'histoire des populations juives et du judaïsme en Belgique/Bronnen voor de geschiedenis van de Joden en het Jodendom in België, 19de-21ste eeuw*\r\n\r\nThis archival guide was analysed and the descriptions relevant to the EHRI project, both in Belgium and abroad, were selected and added to the EHRI portal.\r\n\r\n**C.II.In other countries**\r\n\r\nMany sources are stored in repositories outside of Belgium. First of all, there are the archives of the JDC (with branches in New York and Jerusalem) and of the World Jewish Congress records on Belgium (stored at the Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati). Original documents of the Belgian Jewish Committee in London during the Second World War are available at Yad Vashem (M.22). This committee, founded in 1943 in London by Herman Schamisso, unified a group of Belgian Jewish exiles in London. Their records contain correspondence with various Jewish institutions in Belgium, England, the US and elsewhere. They also contain correspondence with the Belgian government-in-exile about ways of assisting Jews in Belgium and Jews from Belgium in exile abroad. Furthermore, the records include lists of deportees and survivors. In addition to this rich collection, Yad Vashem has both original and copied documents on Jews in Belgium, including on Jewish resistance (M.64, 0.29, 0.44). There are also indirect sources on Jews in Belgium, such as “Documentation regarding the Holocaust from the Central Archives in Moscow, 1939-1945” (M.40) and “Documentation of the Central British Fund” (M.56).\r\n\r\nUSHMM also holds vast materials, both originals and copies, on Jews in Belgium. Their copy collection on Belgium includes copies from Kazerne Dossin, the Directorate-General War for Victims, CEGESOMA, and the National Archives (Foreigners’ Police, *Brüsseler Treuhandgesellschaft* collection, Archive of the Diamond collection and other files). A non-exhaustive list of the copies includes: selected records from the Belgian War Crimes Tribunals and Investigation Records, selected records from the Ministry of Reconstruction of Belgium, selected records from the Belgian Royal Archives, selected records related to the Pierre Beeckmans Anti-Jewish organisation in Belgium, selected records from the City of Liège and from the *Consistoire Central Israélite de Belgique*, and records relating to the Breendonk camp. The original collections include the “Fela and Chaïm Perelman papers” (Acc.nr. 2006.432). Chaïm Perelman (a very influential philosopher in the fields of the philosophy of law and argumentation) founded the \"*Comité de Défense des Juifs*\", the Jewish underground in Belgium. Both Chaïm and Fela worked for the underground during the war. Fela opened a kindergarten called \"Nos Petits\" in 1942 and when the school closed she made efforts to hide Jewish children.\r\n\r\nGerman sources on Belgium during the Second World War are stored at, among other places, the French National Archives at Pierrefitte-sur-Seine (sub-series AJ40), and the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv Freiburg.\r\n\r\n"

Characteristics of the Bulgarian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nBulgaria has a centralised archival system. The state archival institution has changed its name and departmental subordination several times. Now known as the Archives State Agency, its current status is regulated by National Archival Fonds Act, which was adopted in 2007. The organisation of and procedures governing access to the archival records are regulated by the [Law on the National Archival Fonds](http://www.archives.government.bg/images/1279111646.doc), the [Regulation on the procedures for use the records of the National Archival Fonds](http://www.archives.government.bg/uploaded_files/Regulation_USE__EN.pdf) and the [Rules for the procedures and organization of the archival records' use in Archives State Agency (ASA)](http://www.archives.government.bg/uploaded_files/Rules-order_and_organization_of_the_use.doc). All Bulgarian and foreign physical and juridical persons may use the records held by the ASA. The structure of the ASA includes a central archive and six directorates in the regional centres of Burgas, Varna, Tarnovo, Plovdiv, Montana and Sofia. Under them are all the other 27 regional archival branches of ASA. Several other archival institutions contain documents concerning the fate of Jews in Bulgaria during the Second World War. These are the State Military Historical Archives in the city of Veliko Turnovo, the Sofia City Archive, the Archive of the Bulgarian Academy of Science, as well archives in other countries. The most significant collections outside Bulgaria can be found in Yad Vashem, USHMM and different archives in Germany and Russia. The most important information for all future researchers is the expanding digital access to huge collection of archival documents concerning the fate of the Jews in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n**C.

The entire collection is in the process of digitisation. Digital open access is provided, and referred to in the EHRI archival descriptions. Given the huge volume of documents, EHRI’s main aim for Bulgaria has been to present up-to-date and accurate information on the structure of the archives, contacts, logistical information, as well as a description of the volume of documents and a general content description of the main branches of the State Agency Archives and of the Central State Archives itself. EHRI has been able to provide up-to-date summaries of the structure of the fonds, the quantities of documents, as well as descriptions of a small number of representative archival units in these inventories. For example, the Fonds of Commissariat of Jewish Affairs [Комисарство по еврейските въпроси – КЕВ], which is available at the State Archives Agency, contains 15,348 archival units organised in three inventories. The EHRI portal includes links to the Archives State Agency for a number of digitized documents concerning the persecution and protection of Jews in Bulgaria during the Second World War.\r\n\r\n**C.II. Outside of Bulgaria**\r\n\r\nEHRI was able to identify, among other institutions, the German Bundesarchiv in Berlin Lichterfelde and Freiburg, the Politisches Archiv des Auswärtigen Amtes, and Yad Vashem in Israel. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has copied a considerable quantity of Holocaust-relevant archival material from Bulgaria based on the collection of the State Agency Archives. All finding aids links are provided in the EHRI portal.\r\n"

EHRI approach to Belarus: Pre-existing research, available archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nEHRI’s exploration of Holocaust-relevant archival sources in Belarus relied on some important pre-existing research in the field, such as Christian Gerlach’s *Kalkulierte Morde. Die deutsche Wirtschafts- und Vernichtungspolitik in Weißrußland 1941-1944* (1998), which had already made use of archival material available in the country. EHRI was also able to identify a number of helpful archival guides, some of which are available online.\r\n\r\nFor a general overview, which is also available in English, see:\r\n\r\nhttp://archives.gov.by/eng\r\n\r\nMore specialised archival guides include:\r\n\r\n- [2007] Stefan Karner & Vjačeslav Selemenev (Hg.), *Österreicher und Sudetendeutsche vor sowjetischen Militär- und Strafgerichten in Weißrussland 1945–1950* (Graz – Minsk, 2007). This guide provides information about the post-war trials\r\n\r\n- [2003] Kupovetsky, Mark, Eduard Savitsky & Marek Web (eds.), *Dokumenty po istorii i kulture evreev v arkhivach Belarusi* (Documents on the history and culture of Jews in the archives of Belarus) (Moscow: RGGU, 2003)\r\n\r\n- [2003] Zumar, Sergej V., *Dokumente zur Geschichte des Zweiten Weltkrieges in den Staatsarchiven der Republik Belarus.

Characteristics of the Belarusian archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nMost of the central and regional Belarusian archives were founded during the pre-war Soviet period and suffered, to some extent, from fighting, evacuation or occupation. A smaller number of archival institutions was created and began to operate immediately after the German occupiers’ withdrawal from Belarus. There are also some more recently established archival institutions. As a result of regime changes and administrative reforms, many archival institutions in Belarus have been repeatedly renamed, which may cause some initial confusion among researchers.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Belarus**\r\n\r\n**C.I. In Belarus**\r\n\r\nIn Belarus, EHRI identified over 25 archival institutions which hold or may hold Holocaust-relevant material on Belarus. Many of them are concentrated in the country’s capital, Minsk, and environs. Among the numerous provincial centres, the cities of Hrodna and Mahilioŭ each host two Holocaust-relevant archival institutions. Regional, zonal and otherwise specialised archives can be found in all other urban centres of Belarus, i.e. in Baranavičy (Baranovichi), Babrujsk (Bobruisk), Barysaŭ (Borisov), Brest, Dziaržynsk (Dzerzhinsk), Hlybokaje (Glubokoe), Homiel (Gomel), Kobryn (Kobrin), Lida, Mazyr (Mozyr), Orša (Orsha), Pinsk, Polack (Polotsk), Rečyca (Rechitsa) and Viciebsk (Vitebsk).\r\n\r\nThe abovementioned Belarusian archives hold vast numbers of valuable records on all conceivable aspects of the country’s general history: the Minsk-based National Archives alone stores about 1,200 fonds, and almost all regional or zonal archives hold similarly impressive numbers of collections. Given the dimension of mass murder in Belarus during the Second World War, many Holocaust-relevant collections are either known to be stored or can be expected to be found in the country’s archives. On the basis of Sergej V Zumar’s *Dokumente zur Geschichte des Zweiten Weltkrieges in den Staatsarchiven der Republik Belarus. Ein Nachschlagewerk / Dokumenty po istorii Velikoi Otechestvennoi voiny v gosudarstvennykh arkhivach Respubliki Belarus* (2003), EHRI has selected Holocaust-relevant collections among the general mass of sources in Belarus. The descriptions of these selected collections have been copied from the Belarusian online archival catalogue (http://fk.archives.gov.by/catalogue/).\r\n\r\n**C.II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nOutside of Belarus, EHRI has identified and partially described archival institutions and/or collections that may prove relevant to Holocaust research on Belarus, for instance in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Russia. In Israel, Yad Vashem holds a significant documentation from archives in Belarus from 1930 to 1960, containing over 4,000 files. Furthermore, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum stores selected records from the Belarus Central State Archives and from the Homiel, Hrodna and Mahilioŭ regional archives.\r\n"

EHRI approach to Czechia: Pre-existing Research and archival guides, expert support**\r\n\r\nIn the case of Czechia, EHRI was able to rely on a number of pre-existing works, including Livia Rothkirchen’s *The Jews of Bohemia and Moravia. Facing the Holocaust* (2005), works by Miroslav Kárný, the Theresienstädter Studien und Dokumente and other publications. EHRI identified a number of resources useful for Holocaust researchers:\r\n- [2008] Sedláková, Monika. “Co skrývají Okupační vězeňské spisy” in *Terezínské listy* 36 (2008): 198–210.\r\n- [2005] Ptáčníková, Světlana/Vaničková, Vladimíra, “Judaika v Archivu Ministerstva vnitra” in *Sborník Archivu Ministerstva vnitra* 3 (2005): 321-342.\r\n- [2005] Tůma, Oldřich/Jitka Svobodová/Ulrich Mählert, Vademecum Contemporary History Czech Republic. *A Guide to Archives, Research Institutions, Libraries, Associations, Museums and Places of Memorial* (Prague: Institute for Contemporary History, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, 2005).\r\n- [1987] *Státní ústřední archiv v Praze. Průvodce po archivních fondech a sbírkách* (Praha: TEPS, 1987).\r\n- The [National Archives Portal](https://portal.nacr.cz/cro/en/) is the central database of archival collections in Czechia.\r\n- Holocaust.cz portal provides access, apart from other materials, to the database of Holocaust victims and to a growing body of digitised archival material (mostly from the National Archives, but also from other archival institutions).\r\n\r\n**B. Characteristics of the Czech archival system and specific challenges**\r\n\r\nThe Archival system in Czechia consists of the state archives, particularly the National Archives in Prague, and 7 regional archives, which are subordinate to the National Archival Administration [Odbor archivní správy a spisové služby] of the Ministry of Interior. Two other archives, in Opava and Brno, are also de facto regional archives, but are called Zemský, or Land archives, for historical reasons. Furthermore, there are 70 district archives which are subordinated to the respective regional archives. In addition to the mentioned archives, there exist also several specialed and private archives, memory institutions, museums and libraries. Furthermore, there are five archives of the territorial self-governing units worth emphasising, in Prague, Brno, Ostrava, Plzeň and Ústí nad Labem.\r\n\r\n**C. EHRI identification and description results on Czechia** \r\n\r\n**C. I. In Czechia** \r\n\r\nCollections relating to the Second World War and the Holocaust can be found not only in the abovementioned state archives, but also in the Military History Archives, the National Film Archives, the Archive of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and the State Security Archive (which holds the archives of the former communist security services). Furthermore, there is the Terezín Memorial in the former Theresienstadt ghetto which acts as a museum, archive and research institute. Non-state institutions doing research and collecting documents on the Holocaust include the Jewish Museum in Prague and the Prague-based Terezín Initiative Institute, which was founded by former inmates of the Theresienstadt ghetto. In October 2018, EHRI imported 165 top-level archival descriptions prepared by the Jewish Museum in Prague within the framework of the cooperation between EHRI and the [Yerusha project](http://yerusha.eu/).\r\n\r\n**C. II. In other countries**\r\n\r\nEHRI has yet to determine which archival institutions and collections outside of Czechia are relevant to Holocaust research on Czechia. Some holdings of Yad Vashem and Beit Terezin (Israel) have been included in the [EHRI research guides](https://portal.ehri-project.eu/guides/terezin). The USHMM has conducted an extended copying program in the Czech archives, in particular in the National Archives in Prague. Yad Vashem has copied a significant amount of material from the Archives of the Jewish Museum in Prague.\r\n"
