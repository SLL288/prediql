                "history": "Austria was occupied and annexed by the German Reich in March 1938. Many Austrians welcomed this \u201cAnschluss\u201d, after which they were treated as Germans. On April 10, 1938, the \u201cAct on the Reunification of Austria with the German Reich\u201d was recognized by a referendum. Austria was integrated into the general administration of the German Reich and subdivided into seven Reichsgaue in 1939. In 1945, the Red Army took Vienna and eastern parts of the country, while the Western Allies occupied the western and southern sections.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Austria had a total population of about 6,753,000 people. After the \u201cAnschluss\u201d [annexation], 206,000 of them, including refugees from Germany, were persecuted as Jews under the Nuremberg Laws. The Austrian Nazi Party, which had been outlawed before the \u201cAnschluss\u201d, however, did not target only the Jews, but also other ethnic, social and political groups, such as the Roma, their political opponents, the disabled, \u201canti-social elements\u201d, and others. In the process, Austrians became involved in all types of Nazi crimes. In the first days and weeks of Nazi rule, Jews were subjected to brutal outbreaks of violence, including theft and murder. Subsequently, most Jews in the provinces were forced to move to Vienna or abroad. The \u201cZentralstelle f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Auswanderung in Wien\u201d (\u201cCentral Office for Jewish Emigration in Vienna\u201d), founded by the SS in August 1938, not only served as a model for the organisation of the expulsions, but also for the mass deportations from October 1939 onwards. Similar institutions were founded in Berlin, Prague, and Amsterdam. After the November pogroms in 1938, about 6,500 mostly male Jews from Austria were imprisoned, and 4,000 among them were sent to the Dachau concentration camp. By the beginning of the war in September 1939 about 130,000 Jews fled from Austria. During the war, the remaining Jews in Austria were subjected to ever increasing isolation by new regulations, including forced transferal to smaller quarters and the introduction of the obligatory Jewish Star in 1941. Austrian Jews were deported to ghettos, concentration and extermination camps, among others to Nisko, Kielce, Opole, Theresienstadt/Terez\u00edn, Litzmannstadt/\u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Riga, Maly Trostinez/Maly Trascianiec and Auschwitz-Birkenau. In May / June 1944, Jewish prisoners, mostly from Hungary, were moved to camps in Austria, particularly to the Mauthausen concentration camp complex and forced labour camps along the Eastern border. Especially in March and April 1945 thousands of them died on death marches. Overall, around 66,000 Austrian Jews perished in the Holocaust. \r\n\r\nThere were about 11,000 Roma living in Austria before the war. They were subject to harsh racist campaigns throughout the first decades of the 1900s. Shortly after the \u201cAnschluss\u201d in March 1938, Roma and Sinti were deprived of their rights as citizens and several hundred were deported to concentration camps. Since 1939, many detention camps (so-called \u201cZigeunerlager\u201d [\u201cGypsy Camps\u201d]) were erected in several places all over Austria. The largest camp was Lackenbach, which held around 4,000 Roma from the Burgenland. In November 1941, 5007 Austrian Roma were deported to the ghetto in Litzmannstadt. No one survived: They died in the ghetto or were murdered in Kulmhof. Since March 1943, Sinti and Roma were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Of the estimated 11,000 pre-war Roma, Sinti and Lovara population who were Austrian citizens in 1938, only 1,500 to 2,000 survived. ",
                "situation": "Austria exhibits a highly differentiated archival system without much centralization. In addition to the Austrian State Archives and its departments (governed by the Bundesarchivgesetz), each Austrian Bundesland has its own State Archives (each governed by the respective state Archivgesetz or statute). There are over 50 city archives. The religious communities in Austria, first and foremost bodies and organizations of the Catholic Church, have a rich array of archival institutions. There are also university archives, archives of noble houses (in particular the Liechtenstein archives) and a number of other, mostly topical archives as well as libraries holding archival material.",
                "summary": "Key institutions identified by EHRI include the Austrian State Archives [\u00d6sterreichisches Staatsarchiv/ Archiv der Republik] and the respective state archives of the Austrian Bundesl\u00e4nder [Federal States], which hold surviving files of central and regional administrative bodies as well as post-war investigations; the state-operated Archive of the Mauthausen Memorial, which contains files of the Mauthausen concentration camp complex; the Dokumentationsarchiv des \u00d6sterreichischen Widerstandes, which contains material from private hands as well as serving as a hub for highly pertinent copied files accrued from dozens of archives as well as the Forschungsstelle Nachkriegsjustiz, which has collected the scattered information on post-war trials for Nazi war crimes; the Archiv der IKG Wien, which contains the files of the Vienna Jewish community, which encompassed the vast majority of Austrian Jews; the Vienna Wiesenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies, with the holdings of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime and private collections of Holocaust researchers. EHRI has identified a number of general and Holocaust-relevant archival guides and online resources, a full list of which is available in the EHRI extensive report on Austria."

                "history": "Austria was occupied and annexed by the German Reich in March 1938. Many Austrians welcomed this \u201cAnschluss\u201d, after which they were treated as Germans. On April 10, 1938, the \u201cAct on the Reunification of Austria with the German Reich\u201d was recognized by a referendum. Austria was integrated into the general administration of the German Reich and subdivided into seven Reichsgaue in 1939. In 1945, the Red Army took Vienna and eastern parts of the country, while the Western Allies occupied the western and southern sections.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Austria had a total population of about 6,753,000 people. After the \u201cAnschluss\u201d [annexation], 206,000 of them, including refugees from Germany, were persecuted as Jews under the Nuremberg Laws. The Austrian Nazi Party, which had been outlawed before the \u201cAnschluss\u201d, however, did not target only the Jews, but also other ethnic, social and political groups, such as the Roma, their political opponents, the disabled, \u201canti-social elements\u201d, and others. In the process, Austrians became involved in all types of Nazi crimes. In the first days and weeks of Nazi rule, Jews were subjected to brutal outbreaks of violence, including theft and murder. Subsequently, most Jews in the provinces were forced to move to Vienna or abroad. The \u201cZentralstelle f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Auswanderung in Wien\u201d (\u201cCentral Office for Jewish Emigration in Vienna\u201d), founded by the SS in August 1938, not only served as a model for the organisation of the expulsions, but also for the mass deportations from October 1939 onwards. Similar institutions were founded in Berlin, Prague, and Amsterdam. After the November pogroms in 1938, about 6,500 mostly male Jews from Austria were imprisoned, and 4,000 among them were sent to the Dachau concentration camp. By the beginning of the war in September 1939 about 130,000 Jews fled from Austria. During the war, the remaining Jews in Austria were subjected to ever increasing isolation by new regulations, including forced transferal to smaller quarters and the introduction of the obligatory Jewish Star in 1941. Austrian Jews were deported to ghettos, concentration and extermination camps, among others to Nisko, Kielce, Opole, Theresienstadt/Terez\u00edn, Litzmannstadt/\u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Riga, Maly Trostinez/Maly Trascianiec and Auschwitz-Birkenau. In May / June 1944, Jewish prisoners, mostly from Hungary, were moved to camps in Austria, particularly to the Mauthausen concentration camp complex and forced labour camps along the Eastern border. Especially in March and April 1945 thousands of them died on death marches. Overall, around 66,000 Austrian Jews perished in the Holocaust. \r\n\r\nThere were about 11,000 Roma living in Austria before the war. They were subject to harsh racist campaigns throughout the first decades of the 1900s. Shortly after the \u201cAnschluss\u201d in March 1938, Roma and Sinti were deprived of their rights as citizens and several hundred were deported to concentration camps. Since 1939, many detention camps (so-called \u201cZigeunerlager\u201d [\u201cGypsy Camps\u201d]) were erected in several places all over Austria. The largest camp was Lackenbach, which held around 4,000 Roma from the Burgenland. In November 1941, 5007 Austrian Roma were deported to the ghetto in Litzmannstadt. No one survived: They died in the ghetto or were murdered in Kulmhof. Since March 1943, Sinti and Roma were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Of the estimated 11,000 pre-war Roma, Sinti and Lovara population who were Austrian citizens in 1938, only 1,500 to 2,000 survived. ",

In 1945, the Red Army took Vienna and eastern parts of the country, while the Western Allies occupied the western and southern sections.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Austria had a total population of about 6,753,000 people. After the \u201cAnschluss\u201d [annexation], 206,000 of them, including refugees from Germany, were persecuted as Jews under the Nuremberg Laws. The Austrian Nazi Party, which had been outlawed before the \u201cAnschluss\u201d, however, did not target only the Jews, but also other ethnic, social and political groups, such as the Roma, their political opponents, the disabled, \u201canti-social elements\u201d, and others. In the process, Austrians became involved in all types of Nazi crimes. In the first days and weeks of Nazi rule, Jews were subjected to brutal outbreaks of violence, including theft and murder. Subsequently, most Jews in the provinces were forced to move to Vienna or abroad. The \u201cZentralstelle f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Auswanderung in Wien\u201d (\u201cCentral Office for Jewish Emigration in Vienna\u201d), founded by the SS in August 1938, not only served as a model for the organisation of the expulsions, but also for the mass deportations from October 1939 onwards. Similar institutions were founded in Berlin, Prague, and Amsterdam. After the November pogroms in 1938, about 6,500 mostly male Jews from Austria were imprisoned, and 4,000 among them were sent to the Dachau concentration camp. By the beginning of the war in September 1939 about 130,000 Jews fled from Austria. During the war, the remaining Jews in Austria were subjected to ever increasing isolation by new regulations, including forced transferal to smaller quarters and the introduction of the obligatory Jewish Star in 1941. Austrian Jews were deported to ghettos, concentration and extermination camps, among others to Nisko, Kielce, Opole, Theresienstadt/Terez\u00edn, Litzmannstadt/\u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Riga, Maly Trostinez/Maly Trascianiec and Auschwitz-Birkenau. In May / June 1944, Jewish prisoners, mostly from Hungary, were moved to camps in Austria, particularly to the Mauthausen concentration camp complex and forced labour camps along the Eastern border. Especially in March and April 1945 thousands of them died on death marches. Overall, around 66,000 Austrian Jews perished in the Holocaust. \r\n\r\nThere were about 11,000 Roma living in Austria before the war. They were subject to harsh racist campaigns throughout the first decades of the 1900s. Shortly after the \u201cAnschluss\u201d in March 1938, Roma and Sinti were deprived of their rights as citizens and several hundred were deported to concentration camps. Since 1939, many detention camps (so-called \u201cZigeunerlager\u201d [\u201cGypsy Camps\u201d]) were erected in several places all over Austria. The largest camp was Lackenbach, which held around 4,000 Roma from the Burgenland. In November 1941, 5007 Austrian Roma were deported to the ghetto in Litzmannstadt. No one survived: They died in the ghetto or were murdered in Kulmhof. Since March 1943, Sinti and Roma were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Of the estimated 11,000 pre-war Roma, Sinti and Lovara population who were Austrian citizens in 1938, only 1,500 to 2,000 survived. ",

Similar institutions were founded in Berlin, Prague, and Amsterdam. After the November pogroms in 1938, about 6,500 mostly male Jews from Austria were imprisoned, and 4,000 among them were sent to the Dachau concentration camp. By the beginning of the war in September 1939 about 130,000 Jews fled from Austria. During the war, the remaining Jews in Austria were subjected to ever increasing isolation by new regulations, including forced transferal to smaller quarters and the introduction of the obligatory Jewish Star in 1941. Austrian Jews were deported to ghettos, concentration and extermination camps, among others to Nisko, Kielce, Opole, Theresienstadt/Terez\u00edn, Litzmannstadt/\u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Riga, Maly Trostinez/Maly Trascianiec and Auschwitz-Birkenau. In May / June 1944, Jewish prisoners, mostly from Hungary, were moved to camps in Austria, particularly to the Mauthausen concentration camp complex and forced labour camps along the Eastern border. Especially in March and April 1945 thousands of them died on death marches. Overall, around 66,000 Austrian Jews perished in the Holocaust. \r\n\r\nThere were about 11,000 Roma living in Austria before the war. They were subject to harsh racist campaigns throughout the first decades of the 1900s. Shortly after the \u201cAnschluss\u201d in March 1938, Roma and Sinti were deprived of their rights as citizens and several hundred were deported to concentration camps. Since 1939, many detention camps (so-called \u201cZigeunerlager\u201d [\u201cGypsy Camps\u201d]) were erected in several places all over Austria. The largest camp was Lackenbach, which held around 4,000 Roma from the Burgenland. In November 1941, 5007 Austrian Roma were deported to the ghetto in Litzmannstadt. No one survived: They died in the ghetto or were murdered in Kulmhof. Since March 1943, Sinti and Roma were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau.

In May / June 1944, Jewish prisoners, mostly from Hungary, were moved to camps in Austria, particularly to the Mauthausen concentration camp complex and forced labour camps along the Eastern border.

Shortly after the \u201cAnschluss\u201d in March 1938, Roma and Sinti were deprived of their rights as citizens and several hundred were deported to concentration camps. Since 1939, many detention camps (so-called \u201cZigeunerlager\u201d [\u201cGypsy Camps\u201d]) were erected in several places all over Austria. The largest camp was Lackenbach, which held around 4,000 Roma from the Burgenland. In November 1941, 5007 Austrian Roma were deported to the ghetto in Litzmannstadt. No one survived: They died in the ghetto or were murdered in Kulmhof. Since March 1943, Sinti and Roma were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau.

                "history": "Austria was occupied and annexed by the German Reich in March 1938. Many Austrians welcomed this \u201cAnschluss\u201d, after which they were treated as Germans. On April 10, 1938, the \u201cAct on the Reunification of Austria with the German Reich\u201d was recognized by a referendum. Austria was integrated into the general administration of the German Reich and subdivided into seven Reichsgaue in 1939. In 1945, the Red Army took Vienna and eastern parts of the country, while the Western Allies occupied the western and southern sections.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Austria had a total population of about 6,753,000 people. After the \u201cAnschluss\u201d [annexation], 206,000 of them, including refugees from Germany, were persecuted as Jews under the Nuremberg Laws. The Austrian Nazi Party, which had been outlawed before the \u201cAnschluss\u201d, however, did not target only the Jews, but also other ethnic, social and political groups, such as the Roma, their political opponents, the disabled, \u201canti-social elements\u201d, and others. In the process, Austrians became involved in all types of Nazi crimes. In the first days and weeks of Nazi rule, Jews were subjected to brutal outbreaks of violence, including theft and murder. Subsequently, most Jews in the provinces were forced to move to Vienna or abroad. The \u201cZentralstelle f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Auswanderung in Wien\u201d (\u201cCentral Office for Jewish Emigration in Vienna\u201d), founded by the SS in August 1938, not only served as a model for the organisation of the expulsions, but also for the mass deportations from October 1939 onwards. Similar institutions were founded in Berlin, Prague, and Amsterdam. After the November pogroms in 1938, about 6,500 mostly male Jews from Austria were imprisoned, and 4,000 among them were sent to the Dachau concentration camp. By the beginning of the war in September 1939 about 130,000 Jews fled from Austria.

                "history": "Austria was occupied and annexed by the German Reich in March 1938. Many Austrians welcomed this \u201cAnschluss\u201d, after which they were treated as Germans. On April 10, 1938, the \u201cAct on the Reunification of Austria with the German Reich\u201d was recognized by a referendum. Austria was integrated into the general administration of the German Reich and subdivided into seven Reichsgaue in 1939. In 1945, the Red Army took Vienna and eastern parts of the country, while the Western Allies occupied the western and southern sections.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Austria had a total population of about 6,753,000 people. After the \u201cAnschluss\u201d [annexation], 206,000 of them, including refugees from Germany, were persecuted as Jews under the Nuremberg Laws. The Austrian Nazi Party, which had been outlawed before the \u201cAnschluss\u201d, however, did not target only the Jews, but also other ethnic, social and political groups, such as the Roma, their political opponents, the disabled, \u201canti-social elements\u201d, and others. In the process, Austrians became involved in all types of Nazi crimes. In the first days and weeks of Nazi rule, Jews were subjected to brutal outbreaks of violence, including theft and murder. Subsequently, most Jews in the provinces were forced to move to Vienna or abroad. The \u201cZentralstelle f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Auswanderung in Wien\u201d (\u201cCentral Office for Jewish Emigration in Vienna\u201d), founded by the SS in August 1938, not only served as a model for the organisation of the expulsions, but also for the mass deportations from October 1939 onwards. Similar institutions were founded in Berlin, Prague, and Amsterdam. After the November pogroms in 1938, about 6,500 mostly male Jews from Austria were imprisoned, and 4,000 among them were sent to the Dachau concentration camp. By the beginning of the war in September 1939 about 130,000 Jews fled from Austria. During the war, the remaining Jews in Austria were subjected to ever increasing isolation by new regulations, including forced transferal to smaller quarters and the introduction of the obligatory Jewish Star in 1941. Austrian Jews were deported to ghettos, concentration and extermination camps, among others to Nisko, Kielce, Opole, Theresienstadt/Terez\u00edn, Litzmannstadt/\u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Riga, Maly Trostinez/Maly Trascianiec and Auschwitz-Birkenau. In May / June 1944, Jewish prisoners, mostly from Hungary, were moved to camps in Austria, particularly to the Mauthausen concentration camp complex and forced labour camps along the Eastern border. Especially in March and April 1945 thousands of them died on death marches. Overall, around 66,000 Austrian Jews perished in the Holocaust. \r\n\r\nThere were about 11,000 Roma living in Austria before the war.

                "history": "Austria was occupied and annexed by the German Reich in March 1938. Many Austrians welcomed this \u201cAnschluss\u201d, after which they were treated as Germans. On April 10, 1938, the \u201cAct on the Reunification of Austria with the German Reich\u201d was recognized by a referendum. Austria was integrated into the general administration of the German Reich and subdivided into seven Reichsgaue in 1939. In 1945, the Red Army took Vienna and eastern parts of the country, while the Western Allies occupied the western and southern sections.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Austria had a total population of about 6,753,000 people. After the \u201cAnschluss\u201d [annexation], 206,000 of them, including refugees from Germany, were persecuted as Jews under the Nuremberg Laws. The Austrian Nazi Party, which had been outlawed before the \u201cAnschluss\u201d, however, did not target only the Jews, but also other ethnic, social and political groups, such as the Roma, their political opponents, the disabled, \u201canti-social elements\u201d, and others. In the process, Austrians became involved in all types of Nazi crimes. In the first days and weeks of Nazi rule, Jews were subjected to brutal outbreaks of violence, including theft and murder. Subsequently, most Jews in the provinces were forced to move to Vienna or abroad. The \u201cZentralstelle f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Auswanderung in Wien\u201d (\u201cCentral Office for Jewish Emigration in Vienna\u201d), founded by the SS in August 1938, not only served as a model for the organisation of the expulsions, but also for the mass deportations from October 1939 onwards. Similar institutions were founded in Berlin, Prague, and Amsterdam. After the November pogroms in 1938, about 6,500 mostly male Jews from Austria were imprisoned, and 4,000 among them were sent to the Dachau concentration camp. By the beginning of the war in September 1939 about 130,000 Jews fled from Austria. During the war, the remaining Jews in Austria were subjected to ever increasing isolation by new regulations, including forced transferal to smaller quarters and the introduction of the obligatory Jewish Star in 1941. Austrian Jews were deported to ghettos, concentration and extermination camps, among others to Nisko, Kielce, Opole, Theresienstadt/Terez\u00edn, Litzmannstadt/\u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Riga, Maly Trostinez/Maly Trascianiec and Auschwitz-Birkenau. In May / June 1944, Jewish prisoners, mostly from Hungary, were moved to camps in Austria, particularly to the Mauthausen concentration camp complex and forced labour camps along the Eastern border. Especially in March and April 1945 thousands of them died on death marches. Overall, around 66,000 Austrian Jews perished in the Holocaust. \r\n\r\nThere were about 11,000 Roma living in Austria before the war. They were subject to harsh racist campaigns throughout the first decades of the 1900s. Shortly after the \u201cAnschluss\u201d in March 1938, Roma and Sinti were deprived of their rights as citizens and several hundred were deported to concentration camps. Since 1939, many detention camps (so-called \u201cZigeunerlager\u201d [\u201cGypsy Camps\u201d]) were erected in several places all over Austria. The largest camp was Lackenbach, which held around 4,000 Roma from the Burgenland. In November 1941, 5007 Austrian Roma were deported to the ghetto in Litzmannstadt. No one survived: They died in the ghetto or were murdered in Kulmhof. Since March 1943, Sinti and Roma were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Of the estimated 11,000 pre-war Roma, Sinti and Lovara population who were Austrian citizens in 1938, only 1,500 to 2,000 survived. ",

                "history": "Austria was occupied and annexed by the German Reich in March 1938. Many Austrians welcomed this \u201cAnschluss\u201d, after which they were treated as Germans. On April 10, 1938, the \u201cAct on the Reunification of Austria with the German Reich\u201d was recognized by a referendum. Austria was integrated into the general administration of the German Reich and subdivided into seven Reichsgaue in 1939. In 1945, the Red Army took Vienna and eastern parts of the country, while the Western Allies occupied the western and southern sections.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Austria had a total population of about 6,753,000 people. After the \u201cAnschluss\u201d [annexation], 206,000 of them, including refugees from Germany, were persecuted as Jews under the Nuremberg Laws. The Austrian Nazi Party, which had been outlawed before the \u201cAnschluss\u201d, however, did not target only the Jews, but also other ethnic, social and political groups, such as the Roma, their political opponents, the disabled, \u201canti-social elements\u201d, and others. In the process, Austrians became involved in all types of Nazi crimes. In the first days and weeks of Nazi rule, Jews were subjected to brutal outbreaks of violence, including theft and murder. Subsequently, most Jews in the provinces were forced to move to Vienna or abroad. The \u201cZentralstelle f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Auswanderung in Wien\u201d (\u201cCentral Office for Jewish Emigration in Vienna\u201d), founded by the SS in August 1938, not only served as a model for the organisation of the expulsions, but also for the mass deportations from October 1939 onwards. Similar institutions were founded in Berlin, Prague, and Amsterdam. After the November pogroms in 1938, about 6,500 mostly male Jews from Austria were imprisoned, and 4,000 among them were sent to the Dachau concentration camp. By the beginning of the war in September 1939 about 130,000 Jews fled from Austria. During the war, the remaining Jews in Austria were subjected to ever increasing isolation by new regulations, including forced transferal to smaller quarters and the introduction of the obligatory Jewish Star in 1941. Austrian Jews were deported to ghettos, concentration and extermination camps, among others to Nisko, Kielce, Opole, Theresienstadt/Terez\u00edn, Litzmannstadt/\u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Riga, Maly Trostinez/Maly Trascianiec and Auschwitz-Birkenau. In May / June 1944, Jewish prisoners, mostly from Hungary, were moved to camps in Austria, particularly to the Mauthausen concentration camp complex and forced labour camps along the Eastern border. Especially in March and April 1945 thousands of them died on death marches. Overall, around 66,000 Austrian Jews perished in the Holocaust. \r\n\r\nThere were about 11,000 Roma living in Austria before the war. They were subject to harsh racist campaigns throughout the first decades of the 1900s. Shortly after the \u201cAnschluss\u201d in March 1938, Roma and Sinti were deprived of their rights as citizens and several hundred were deported to concentration camps. Since 1939, many detention camps (so-called \u201cZigeunerlager\u201d [\u201cGypsy Camps\u201d]) were erected in several places all over Austria. The largest camp was Lackenbach, which held around 4,000 Roma from the Burgenland. In November 1941, 5007 Austrian Roma were deported to the ghetto in Litzmannstadt. No one survived: They died in the ghetto or were murdered in Kulmhof. Since March 1943, Sinti and Roma were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Of the estimated 11,000 pre-war Roma, Sinti and Lovara population who were Austrian citizens in 1938, only 1,500 to 2,000 survived. ",

                "history": "Austria was occupied and annexed by the German Reich in March 1938. Many Austrians welcomed this \u201cAnschluss\u201d, after which they were treated as Germans. On April 10, 1938, the \u201cAct on the Reunification of Austria with the German Reich\u201d was recognized by a referendum. Austria was integrated into the general administration of the German Reich and subdivided into seven Reichsgaue in 1939. In 1945, the Red Army took Vienna and eastern parts of the country, while the Western Allies occupied the western and southern sections.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Austria had a total population of about 6,753,000 people. After the \u201cAnschluss\u201d [annexation], 206,000 of them, including refugees from Germany, were persecuted as Jews under the Nuremberg Laws. The Austrian Nazi Party, which had been outlawed before the \u201cAnschluss\u201d, however, did not target only the Jews, but also other ethnic, social and political groups, such as the Roma, their political opponents, the disabled, \u201canti-social elements\u201d, and others. In the process, Austrians became involved in all types of Nazi crimes. In the first days and weeks of Nazi rule, Jews were subjected to brutal outbreaks of violence, including theft and murder. Subsequently, most Jews in the provinces were forced to move to Vienna or abroad. The \u201cZentralstelle f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Auswanderung in Wien\u201d (\u201cCentral Office for Jewish Emigration in Vienna\u201d), founded by the SS in August 1938, not only served as a model for the organisation of the expulsions, but also for the mass deportations from October 1939 onwards. Similar institutions were founded in Berlin, Prague, and Amsterdam. After the November pogroms in 1938, about 6,500 mostly male Jews from Austria were imprisoned, and 4,000 among them were sent to the Dachau concentration camp. By the beginning of the war in September 1939 about 130,000 Jews fled from Austria. During the war, the remaining Jews in Austria were subjected to ever increasing isolation by new regulations, including forced transferal to smaller quarters and the introduction of the obligatory Jewish Star in 1941. Austrian Jews were deported to ghettos, concentration and extermination camps, among others to Nisko, Kielce, Opole, Theresienstadt/Terez\u00edn, Litzmannstadt/\u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Riga, Maly Trostinez/Maly Trascianiec and Auschwitz-Birkenau. In May / June 1944, Jewish prisoners, mostly from Hungary, were moved to camps in Austria, particularly to the Mauthausen concentration camp complex and forced labour camps along the Eastern border. Especially in March and April 1945 thousands of them died on death marches. Overall, around 66,000 Austrian Jews perished in the Holocaust. \r\n\r\nThere were about 11,000 Roma living in Austria before the war. They were subject to harsh racist campaigns throughout the first decades of the 1900s. Shortly after the \u201cAnschluss\u201d in March 1938, Roma and Sinti were deprived of their rights as citizens and several hundred were deported to concentration camps. Since 1939, many detention camps (so-called \u201cZigeunerlager\u201d [\u201cGypsy Camps\u201d]) were erected in several places all over Austria. The largest camp was Lackenbach, which held around 4,000 Roma from the Burgenland. In November 1941, 5007 Austrian Roma were deported to the ghetto in Litzmannstadt. No one survived: They died in the ghetto or were murdered in Kulmhof. Since March 1943, Sinti and Roma were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Of the estimated 11,000 pre-war Roma, Sinti and Lovara population who were Austrian citizens in 1938, only 1,500 to 2,000 survived. ",
