Use realistic literals or known real values.\n    3) You may attempt injected strings, nulls, overlong strings, and type mismatches where appropriate.\n    4) You may output 1 query(ies) but MUST cover all vulnerability types listed above.\n    5) Do not use the words \"edges\" or \"node\".\n    6) GraphQL is case-sensitive. Match the exact operation name: deleteLocation.\n    7) If there are previous response pairs, use them to generate the query.\n    8) For each vulnerability type, craft queries that specifically test for that vulnerability pattern.\n    9) CRITICAL: Label each query with its vulnerability type using the format: ***<vulnerability_type>*** before each ```graphql block.\n    10) SPECIAL CASE: For Query Deny Bypass, you MUST generate TWO queries:\n        - First query: Non-aliased version (normal query structure)\n        - Second query: Aliased version (using query aliases like \"s: queryName\")\n        Both queries should test the same operation but with different structures to test access control bypass.\n    \n    SCHEMA (authoritative):\n    - schema types: {'Location': {'kind': 'OBJECT', 'fields': [{'name': 'id', 'type': 'ID!'}, {'name': 'lat', 'type': 'Float'}, {'name': 'lng', 'type': 'Float'}, {'name': 'name', 'type': 'String!'}]}}\n    - output fields (if known): Location\n    Use only fields/args compatible with this schema.\n    \n    Context:\n    - operation: deleteLocation\n    - input (declared): deleteLocation, input: {'locationID': 'ID!'}\n    - node type: mutation\n    \n    Output format:\n    Each query must be in its own fenced block with a vulnerability type label:\n    Vulnerability Type Labels Are:\n    - SQL_Injection\n    - XSS_Injection\n    - SSRF_Injection\n    - OS_Command_Injection\n    - Path_Injection\n    - HTML_Injection\n    - Query_Deny_Bypass_Non_Aliased\n    - Query_Deny_Bypass_Aliased\n    - Introspection\n    - Field_Suggestions\n    - Basic_Call\n\n    ***<Vulnerability Type>***\n    ```graphql\n    <your query>\n    ```\n    \n    Example:\n    ***SQL_Injection***\n    ```graphql\n    query {\n      users(filter: \"1' OR '1'='1\") {\n        id\n        name\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    \n    ***XSS_Injection***\n    ```graphql\n    query {\n      search(term: \"<script>alert('xss')</script>\") {\n        results\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    ",
  "llm_response": "```\nPlease note that the \"Query_Deny_Bypass_Aliased\" query is not using the exact schema but rather an invented alias as per your requirement. If it's not correctly done, you may need to adjust it according to your schema. \n\nPlease note that to use any of the GraphQL API's built-in security measures such as `@deprecated` directive or other security-related context, use cases may need to be implemented differently.\n\nThese queries cover all vulnerability types and their corresponding edge cases as per the provided requirements:\n\n1. Basic functionality offered by the operation.\n2. SQL Injection, using a basic injection as the query (`\"5' OR 1=1 ---\"`).\n3. XSS Injection when injecting a script (`<script>alert('xss')</script>`).\n4. SSRF Injection with an explicitly defined address.\n5. OS Command Injection via an injection of `ls -l /`.\n6. Path Injection with an explicitly defined PATH (`file:///etc/passwd`).\n7. HTML Injection by exploiting a misconfigured SVG parsing setup, let's replace `\"Image\"` with a potentially played \"Flash SVG `<object>`66677SBPrimitive\"?
