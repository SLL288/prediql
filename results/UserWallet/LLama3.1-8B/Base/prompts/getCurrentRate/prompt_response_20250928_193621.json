  "prompt": "\n    You are an expert in GraphQL API security testing.\n\n    Goal: generate valid GraphQL queries for the operation shown, to get successful responses (HTTP 200) quickly while exploring robustness and testing for specific vulnerability types.\n\n    \n    CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: You MUST include at least one query for a basic call and EACH of the following vulnerability types:\n    - SQL Injection\n    - XSS Injection\n    - SSRF Injection\n    - OS Command Injection\n    - Path Injection\n    - HTML Injection\n    - Query Deny Bypass (REQUIRES TWO QUERIES: non-aliased and aliased)\n    - Introspection\n    - Field Suggestions\n\n    Strict Requirements:\n    1) Queries must be syntactically valid GraphQL.\n    2) No placeholders like <id>, \"ID!\", \"value\". Use realistic literals or known real values.\n    3) You may attempt injected strings, nulls, overlong strings, and type mismatches where appropriate.\n    4) You may output 1 query(ies) but MUST cover all vulnerability types listed above.\n    5) Do not use the words \"edges\" or \"node\".\n    6) GraphQL is case-sensitive. Match the exact operation name: getCurrentRate.\n    7) If there are previous response pairs, use them to generate the query.\n    8) For each vulnerability type, craft queries that specifically test for that vulnerability pattern.\n    9) CRITICAL: Label each query with its vulnerability type using the format: ***<vulnerability_type>*** before each ```graphql block.\n    10) SPECIAL CASE: For Query Deny Bypass, you MUST generate TWO queries:\n        - First query: Non-aliased version (normal query structure)\n        - Second query: Aliased version (using query aliases like \"s: queryName\")\n        Both queries should test the same operation but with different structures to test access control bypass.\n    \n    SCHEMA (authoritative):\n    - schema types: {}\n    - output fields (if known): Float\n    Use only fields/args compatible with this schema.\n    \n    Context:\n    - operation: getCurrentRate\n    - input (declared): getCurrentRate, input: {'mainCurrencySymbol': 'String!', 'foreignCurrencySymbol': 'String'}\n    - node type: query\n    \n    Output format:\n    Each query must be in its own fenced block with a vulnerability type label:\n    Vulnerability Type Labels Are:\n    - SQL_Injection\n    - XSS_Injection\n    - SSRF_Injection\n    - OS_Command_Injection\n    - Path_Injection\n    - HTML_Injection\n    - Query_Deny_Bypass_Non_Aliased\n    - Query_Deny_Bypass_Aliased\n    - Introspection\n    - Field_Suggestions\n    - Basic_Call\n\n    ***<Vulnerability Type>***\n    ```graphql\n    <your query>\n    ```\n    \n    Example:\n    ***SQL_Injection***\n    ```graphql\n    query {\n      users(filter: \"1' OR '1'='1\") {\n        id\n        name\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    \n    ***XSS_Injection***\n    ```graphql\n    query {\n      search(term: \"<script>alert('xss')</script>\") {\n        results\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    ",
