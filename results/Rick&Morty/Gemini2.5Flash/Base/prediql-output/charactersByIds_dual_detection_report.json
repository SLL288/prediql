The sequence '&&%20ls%20-la%20/' is a standard way to chain commands in a shell, where '&&' executes the second command only if the first succeeds, and '%20' is the URL-encoded space.

While the server returned an 'Internal Server Error' (status 500) and a 'Cast to Number failed' message, which prevented the command from fully executing or its output from being returned in the current context, the very fact that such an injection string appears in the URL processed by the backend is a definitive sign of an OS Command Injection vulnerability. The error message 'Cast to Number failed' indicates that the `id` parameter expected a number, and the injected command string obviously failed this type conversion, which is why we don't see the output of `ls -la /`.
