In contrast, the aliased query, although having an error in its syntax, still returns data. This suggests that the aliased query is able to bypass access control. Considering the nature of GraphQL query aliases, it seems that the server is not properly enforcing access controls, allowing the query to succeed even with an error in its syntax. This warrants further investigation to confirm the severity of the issue. I rate the confidence level as 0.8, as there is a clear discrepancy between the behavior of aliased and non-aliased queries, and the aliased query does return data, albeit with an error. Therefore, this is a potential query deny bypass vulnerability.",
