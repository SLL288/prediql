However, I found a subtle vulnerability:\n\n* The aliased query returns a syntax error, but I suspect this is not a correct interpretation of a bypass. The error message \"Expected {, found :\" suggests that the query is blocked due to invalid syntax rather than access control.\n\nHowever, considering the context of the object, the non-aliased query is returning an empty \"results\" array while the aliased query returns an error. This might indicate that the aliased query is forced through due to its syntax, bypassing the intended access control. The presence of errors in the response does not provide clear evidence of a bypass, but the different outcomes between non-aliased and aliased queries raise eyes.\n\nBased on the conservation of doubts policy, I will mark this as **LOW** severity and **Potential vulnerability**.\n\n**Rating:**\n* `is_vulnerable`: false\n* `vulnerability_type`: \"query_deny_bypass\"\n* `severity`: \"LOW\"\n* `confidence`: 0.6 (indicating a high potential)\n* `evidence`: \"aliased query returns syntax error while non-aliased query returns empty results\"\n* `explanation`: \"Potential query deny bypass due to different outcomes, but unclear intentions behind the error in aliased query\"",

However, I found a subtle vulnerability:\n\n* The aliased query returns a syntax error, but I suspect this is not a correct interpretation of a bypass. The error message \"Expected {, found :\" suggests that the query is blocked due to invalid syntax rather than access control.\n\nHowever, considering the context of the object, the non-aliased query is returning an empty \"results\" array while the aliased query returns an error. This might indicate that the aliased query is forced through due to its syntax, bypassing the intended access control. The presence of errors in the response does not provide clear evidence of a bypass, but the different outcomes between non-aliased and aliased queries raise eyes.\n\nBased on the conservation of doubts policy, I will mark this as **LOW** severity and **Potential vulnerability**.\n\n**Rating:**\n* `is_vulnerable`: false\n* `vulnerability_type`: \"query_deny_bypass\"\n* `severity`: \"LOW\"\n* `confidence`: 0.6 (indicating a high potential)\n* `evidence`: \"aliased query returns syntax error while non-aliased query returns empty results\"\n* `explanation`: \"Potential query deny bypass due to different outcomes, but unclear intentions behind the error in aliased query\""
