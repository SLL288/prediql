In a standard GraphQL resolver, this error typically occurs because the server is not configured to handle queries with introspection or because the server has not properly set up schema metadata. This hint suggests that the server might be emitting schema information through its error messages, which is a key characteristic of an Introspection Vulnerability.\n**Explanation:** GraphQL Introspection vulnerabilities allow an attacker to extract sensitive schema information, including field types, argument names, and even specific types (e.g., DateTime or Int). Attackers can use this insight to write targeted queries that could lead to information disclosure.\n\nWhile I couldn't directly identify clear evidence of schema information exposure or DEV-validated headers, the unusual query result along with an error about an unknown argument suggests a potential path to Introspection.
