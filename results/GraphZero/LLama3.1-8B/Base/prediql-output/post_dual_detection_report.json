              "evidence": "The presence of the 'body' field with a value of null in the response indicates potential HTML injection vulnerability. An attacker could manipulate this field to inject malicious HTML content.",
              "explanation": "The lack of validation or sanitization on the 'body' field in the GraphQL payload can lead to HTML injection attacks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a request with a carefully crafted 'body' field that includes malicious HTML tags. In this case, the response does not provide any indication of validation or sanitization on the 'body' field, raising concerns about potential HTML injection attacks. Given the potential for attack and impact on the system, I rate the severity of this vulnerability as HIGH."
