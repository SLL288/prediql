This is a field-suggestion/schema-disclosure issue because the server is exposing type names, argument names and types, and correct usage in error text. An attacker can use these messages to enumerate fields and signatures, enabling targeted probing, more effective mutations, and easier discovery of other endpoints/arguments. Recommended mitigations: suppress detailed GraphQL validation errors in production (return generic error messages), disable or restrict introspection where appropriate, implement error masking/centralized logging, and validate/mask server responses so schema details are not returned to untrusted callers.""}}]"
