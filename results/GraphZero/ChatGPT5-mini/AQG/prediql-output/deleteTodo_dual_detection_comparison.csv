This constitutes an information-disclosure / introspection risk because an attacker can infer API shape and iterate queries to map the schema. Recommended mitigations: suppress or genericize error messages in production, disable or restrict GraphQL introspection for unauthenticated clients, require authentication/authorization for schema discovery, and apply rate limiting to reduce automated enumeration.""}}]"
